Overview
The 'yelp_scrape.py' Python program is designed to extract restaurant data from yelp.com. Specifically, it collects the restaurant name, address, rating, and first 10 reviews for restaurants in San Francisco, USA.
The data collected is saved to a file named 'data.json'.
The program may take a few minutes to complete, as it waits for a few seconds between each request to avoid overloading the server.
Once completed, the 'data.json' file will contain a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a restaurant and its corresponding data.
