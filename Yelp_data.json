        "Leanna L.": "food was SO SO good DEFINITELY recommend this restaurant! lavender lemonade: such a fun drink! the lavender taste is not too overpowering, and the little bit of sparkle leaves your mouth going in for another sip :) beet and pear salad: AMAZING! the cheese, the sweet pear and beets the light flavor profile *muah* (made me feel healthy while eating something super good) kimchi rice balls: AHHHHH the crunch of the outside and the explosion of flavor on the inside was creaminess of the mayo tied the dish all together!! hamachi collar: i have no idea what sauce they used (gingery, tangy flavor) but it tasted SO good with the hamachi! the meat was super tender and melts in your mouth.  tom yum: um YUM! the fried pork belly and the creamy egg yolk complimented the delicious flavor of the soup (i personally wasn't able to handle the \"fire\" version so i got mild and it did not disappoint!) ~ the service was incredible! helped our table with deciding what to order, how much to order, and continued to check in throughout the night making sure that everything was all good! (cracked a couple jokes too and made the dinner fun and delicious ) ~ i absolutely LOVE the aesthetics of this restaurant! you're able to see into the kitchen, the tables and chairs are minimalistic in the best way, and the layout works so well. plating is SUPER cute too!"

        "Diane Z.": "Food took a while, but was very well flavored. Got the salmon and it was very tender. The curry was very rich but surprisingly wasn't super oily tasting. Probably helped that it was a bit foamy.  My partner got the cold noodles and it was very well cooked. Noodles were perfectly al dente and the meat on top was sizzling hot."

        "Jacqueline Z.": "Had an absolutely AMAZING experience here! My partner and I had a reservation for 8:30 PM on a Saturday night, and when we arrived, it was fully packed with a few parties waiting. The restaurant is quite small so I'd recommend getting a reservation if you don't want to wait.  My partner has a nut allergy and they were very attentive and made sure to explain which dishes had nuts and whether we could get some of the nut-related stuff on the side, like peanut sauce. We asked our server for recs and he was very thorough in his explanations.  We ordered: Thai Iced Tea (5/5): This was soooo good! A lot of other tables near ours were ordering thai iced teas as well, and there's a good reason for that :) Korean Rice Balls (5/5): Absolutely delicious. The white sauce at the bottom paired with the cheese on the top and the crusty breading really made it flavorful and yummy. The kimchi fried rice in the balls was also really good as a filling. Beef Skirt (5/5): There's this green sauce at the bottom of the dish and the person who brought it out told us to make sure to eat every bite with some of the sauce. He was not wrong! It was so tender and paired with the sauce - divine! Spicy Korean Noodles (4.5/5): We got this with peanut sauce on the side. The pork jowl was cooked really well and the noodles themselves were quite good. Pairing it with the peanut sauce gave it a whole other flavor that was nutty but also a bit savory.  They also had some green spicy sauce and some chilies made in-house if you wanted to add them to any of the dishes. The green spicy sauce definitely has a kick to it that builds up, but I love spicy food, so it was the perfect addition. They also gave us a garlic aioli for a non-spicy sauce.  The people working there are super friendly and explained each dish when they brought it out to us. It felt very homey and this one guy was super attentive with refilling water too!"

        "Elizabeth C.": "- everything about kothai is aesthetic - they have a gorgeous, modern interior with wood tones, and their choice of tableware is minimalist, but sophisticated. my friends were impressed by the weight of the sharing plates haha - the menu isn't that extensive (only 1 page long), and they seem to change it periodically - service could've been a little better. we had a pretty large group so we made a reservation, but still had to wait a fair bit before being seated. they also took a while to take our order and get us the check.  - portions are larger IRL than in the pictures which we were pleasantly surprised by! - they have a garlic chili crunch sauce and a green garlic chili sauce which was actually pretty spicy - spicy korean noodle (3/5): the plating was nice, but the flavors did not impress me unfortunately. this is a cold noodle dish (which the waitress double-checked i knew after i ordered) that comes with pork jowl. the pork was a little too salty and the spicy sauce that the noodles were coated in wasn't anything impressive. it wasn't that spicy, but you can definitely feel it on your lips by the time you finish your meal. - korean BBQ skirt (4/5): steak was at a perfect medium rare, and super juicy and flavorful. the kalbi marinade was just the right amount of sweetness, and paired well with the burnt onion puree/sauce which was earthy, full of umami, and had just the right hint of horseradish. a little on the pricey side though. - i tried my friend's beef noodle soup, and it just tasted like taiwanese beef noodle soup with more mild flavors.  - kothai attempts a korean and thai fusion, however the fusion of the flavors from these two cuisines doesn't seem to complement one another too well. the flavors are just a little off, and leaves me craving the authentic version instead. - i had been wanting to try this place due to the hype, and though it is very aesthetically pleasing, the food unfortunately fell flat, and i most likely wouldn't come back again"

        "Irene P.": "Walked in without reservations and was able to get seated within 10 minutes of waitlisting. The restaurant is small and the tables are close to one another. Nonetheless, the service was impeccable. I was in need of water from the chilis and it was always refilled without asking.  The food was yummy! We ordered the Tom Yum, (mild), Grilled Hamachi Collar, Kimchi Rice Ball and Korean Spicy Noodle. The hamachi collar was meaty and fresh; the pairing sauce was citrusy and spicy. Despite the grilling of the skin, it was difficult to consume due to the scales. The Tom yum was on the sweeter side and paired well with the additional chili complements. The kimchi rice ball was crispy on the outside and tasted like kimchi fried rice in ball form. Typically, I'm not a huge fan of cold noodle but the Korean spicy noodle was tasty. It had enough veggies and sauce."

        "Victoria K.": "Ambiance: it's cozy - great for night out with friends. Maybe a little tight for romantic date night. Servers were all super friendly and gave great recommendations on the menu.  Food: Kbbq Skirt Steak [4/5]: yummy, tender, juicy - with fantastic marinade. Burnt onion puree was a nice sweet touch.  Hamachi collar [4/5]: probably my favorite part of any fish because the meat is so tender here. (My BF thought it was slightly fishy but he isn't a huge seafood fan - I thought it was perfectly fine) Skin was crispy as well and loved the kick of the chili oil.  Ceviche [5/5]: this dish came first and WOW. I absolutely LOVED this. The red shrimp had a nice tangy bite, loved the kick of the garlic. Had great texture, was super fresh, light, and super tasty. 10/10 recommend!!  Korean Spicy Noodle [4/5]: was yummy and what you'd expect from spicy cold noodles. The grilled pork jowl had tasty marinade on it (my BF said it tasted like tofu hahaha - not a bad thing just an interesting comment) but was enjoyable. It was kinda cold that day so probably shouldve gone with a soupy noodle.  Apple Pie Cheesecake [4/5]: cheesecake in a mason jar - super cute and yummy. Tasted exactly like your traditional apple pie and of fall :)"

        "Lisa X.": "The level of customer service my husband and I received here on our first visit is on par with, if not exceed some of the other fancier places we have been to. I feel that the marriage of good food, excellent service, and aesthetically pleasing environment will really make this restaurant a stand out among its peers. Our favorite dish here is the Korean BBQ skirt - beautifully presented and tasted so delicious with a perfect sear. Inside is almost black and blue (rare), soft and tender (except for one piece), the burnt onion pure on the bottom is not overpowering and made this a star in this meal. Thai chicken toast is a creative take on chicken satay on bread. Very tasty. Tom Yum Noodle Soup while yummy is not a favorite for me or for my husband on this particular visit. But I do like the soft egg (creamy), shrimp and the crispy pork belly pieces. I do want to say that I'm not keen on eating a lot of carbs either so this may factor into this dish not being a favorite. Thai iced tea - no photo. Tasted good, refreshing and goes well with the dishes.  The ambiance of the restaurant is lovely, everything beautifully plated and again, the service was superb. I wouldn't hesitate on coming back to trying more dishes and bringing friends along."

        "Sam K.": "In a quiet corner of inner sunset sits a mighty new entrant to the food scene of San Francisco. A notable new entrant that had us salivating for more and planning our next meal already. Chef Mohammed is an artist with 30+ years of fine dining experience. This according to him is his last gig, and he went vegetarian and vegan for his labor of love. This is Arabic fine dining at its best. Beit Rima used to be our favorite but that throne is now with savor cafe. Chef Mohammed reimagines Arabic classics and like an artist working with his muse, transforms the familiar into the sublime. You get fine dining refined palette at a fraction of the cost of any etoile conferred by Michelin. We had an incredibly challenging time selecting the dishes, since so many dishes spoke to us. We asked the sole server, who was also doubling up as the person behind the counter, making beverages and communicating with the sole employee in the kitchen - chef Mohammed - one man genius who is proud of his roots. We started with a turmeric oat milk chai that was caffeine free but had sage and hints of some wonderful spices that warm you up on a cold San Francisco evening. Next up was the savor platter, which takes what could've been your hummus baba ganouj pita platter and transforms it into a charcuterie board with whipped hummus, an insanely delicious babaganouj, a mint infused hummus, saffron and eggplant dip, and melt in your mouth falafel like you have never tasted before. Served with high quality pita. Definitely order.  Next up was the dish of the year for us called Mashi: Baby eggplant stuffed with leeks, anaheim peppers, organic corn, sumac, pine nuts, served over yogurt garlic sauce. It is served warm on a ceramic hot plate. The taste borders on umami and the melange of ingredients offer an explosion of flavors that are enhanced by the sumac and garlic sauce. Definitely order. A vegan version of the yoghurt garlic sauce is available.  Up next was the Saffron Kufta: Beyond meat, shimeji mushrooms, mint, parsley, allspice, shallots, & bell pepper with saffron sauce. This is ideal for the meat lovers who want the taste and texture of minced meat with a saffron bbq sauce. I am not the biggest fans of beyond meat, so I'll pass this next time. But the texture, mouth feel and flavors were incredible. However in comparison to the other 2 dishes, this one ranks a notch below, perhaps because beyond meat has a distinct flavor already.  Our final dish for the night, as the friendly server informed us that the chef recommends 4 dishes for a party of 2, was the Wild Mushroom Knaffe: wild mushrooms with vegan cheese, baked in shredded phyllo, topped with a roasted tomato-bell pepper sauce. This dish looks like it belongs in a Michelin starred restaurant. It has many layers, textures and is delicately put together with a birds nest of shredded phyllo strands. In terms of quantity this one is rather small, but incredibly packed full of flavor. However by now we were so satiated that this was our third favorite after the mashi and savor platter that defined the ceiling of where this experience could take us. Finally we savored two desserts that made the Savor Cafe experience complete and we could safely say with a wide margin that this was the best meal we had in 2023 in California. The blueberry dessert had hints of rose water and the texture of halva, soft and tender, not too sweet and incredibly addictive. Our winner for the desserts. While the next one was an almond torte that is served warm with layers of what felt like marzipan. Incredible but takes second place to the blueberry pie.  Savor cafe is doing something right in a city that is struggling to shine after the pandemic. Chef Mohammed is working really hard to make fine dining accessible with an experience that you will relish. This was a perfect date night for us with a meal that was memorable to the soundtrack of sonorous Yemeni music.  Must try! Restaurant of the month, and probably of the year. We can't wait to come back and try some of the other pieces of art."

        "Ed U.": "This isn't the same as the Savor that was on 24th in Noe Valley, is it? I have a distinct memory of chomping on a grilled hangar steak with mashed potatoes at that Savor, but there was no hint of meat on this menu. No, this is a vegan/vegetarian Arabic cafe right off the N line on Irving. That's how I got here and found this warm, inviting corner cafe. The owner and cook were busy fulfilling two large lunch orders for two different women who merely stood and looked at their phones. I managed to squeeze in my order for one, the $15 Portobello Mushroom Shawarma which came with onion, sumac, and roasted tomato wrapped in grilled lavash bread slathered with garlic lemon tahini (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F438RjbC&s=599f9b329a3f364a904621fceea4632b27d941d202f322affb76fee8f8eacf0f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/438RjbC</a>). It came with a hefty side salad of mixed greens tossed in their house dressing. There was no Diet Coke to be found, so I tried to quench my thirst with Coconut Water (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F40IiacC&s=cd6265b1226b76f59d600eadafb95aa6341031ef9c37b702a398f616b1c179da\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/40IiacC</a>). Because the owner felt badly for how long I had to wait for my order due to the large lunch orders, he gave me a complimentary slice of their tasty Bread Pudding with blueberries (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3zD5dVy&s=ab80109f8260a618dc2e88cf2121cb252ec32c6e4b739f7d010f3625ed87cdc3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3zD5dVy</a>).

Upon entering this restaurant we were immediately greeted by the Mohamed, the chef/owner, owner who was a fun character to talk to. When I asked him about the turmeric latte, he said \"it's hella good\". All of his recommendations were spot on as we were new to this food. I had the Green Spanish Melt and I'll be forever craving it. The mouthful of flavors was incredible. The only disappointment was that they were out of the curry lentil soup which accompanies the sandwich. An arugula salad was substituted which was adequate. By the way, all the food is either vegan or vegetarian. My friends aren't vegetarian as I am and they did not miss having meat at their meal at all. We learned that at dinner there is no corkage fee- a nice plus. I guarantee we shall return!"

The king trumpet is so juicy and seasoned well, and the \"buns\" of the burger are made from a croissant like pastry that complements the burger so well. Highly recommend trying this one Savor Platter (4/5)- Good mix of different dips Potato & Sage Torte (4/5)- what's not to love about potato and phyllo?

Be careful though, there is usually about an hour to two hour wait anytime you come during peak lunch or dinner hours, especially during the weekend. I would recommend coming during off hours of the day, like 3pm or 9:30pm, right before closing (although you might risk not being able to get a table at all). They also have a robust to go system, if you'd like your food without a long wait. I always get the Chicken Paitan. The chicken is perfectly juicy, and the egg is nice with a hard white and jammy yolk. The noodles are thin and beautifully al dente, and there aren't too many overwhelming toppings that take away from the main event. The true standout, however, is the broth. It's one of the best broths I've ever had, made even better by being one of the few places that actually offers a chicken broth (I don't eat pork, so usually I have to go for vegetarian options at most ramen shops. Service is incredibly quick, almost too quick, but all of the servers are so kind and friendly, which makes the experience of eating there wonderful. Always my go-to in Japantown."

I don't think you can join the waitlist from your phone but when you get to the restaurant, there's a yelp waitlist on the tablet. Luckily you can just browse the different shops while you wait. Although, most stores do close early. There's also a lot of seating inside the mall so you can sit while you wait.  The restaurant is pretty small so the tables are pretty close to each other. The service is great. The food comes out pretty quick and is always good. I love getting the Hakata Tonkotsu. It is a rich and creamy broth. The gyoza dumplings are also really good.  The staff is very attentive. They would clear dishes for us pretty quickly when we were done with it to clear room on our table. I also accidentally dropped my chopstick and they gave me a new one."

I got their vegan ramen with green onions on the side and it was so flavorful and all the ingredients were so fresh. The service was amazing and all the staff their were so sweet and attentive. The inside is pretty busy and the tables are pretty close together, so something to note if you're looking for a more open calm restaurant experience.  I highly recommend!

We got greeted and seated very quickly! Menu had consistency with options but I do wish they had more egg or vegan options. Server was nice enough to mention noodles had egg so I was able to substitute it for rice.  Ambiance is really nice. Small place but it can get packed pretty fast during lunch.

        "Benjamin G.": "Maybe it's just the dish I ordered (Spicy Tan Tan Men), but I find it hard to recommend the ramen here. I saw a review about how this is \"authentic\" ramen, but I find that hard to believe. I've tried ramen in Sapporo, Hokkaido as well as in Furano on the same island, and in all cases the ramen there is 2 or 3 levels above the one I had. The ramen texture here is mostly average, but the soup base is really mediocre. It's spicy, but not that spicy, but the taste is otherwise very bland. I usually enjoy slurping the ramen base because of the rich flavor, but I gave up after a few scoops with this one. It isn't a complete negative as the service is amazing, but that isn't enough to offset the quality of the ramen. Otherwise, the decor is quite nice, with wooden paneling all around, but is otherwise fairly small."

The chicken karaage was okay, but I thought the Ramen was kind of lacking. The broth tasted a bit off and the noodles were a little undercooked. They also had way too much Red Ginger in the soup which was throwing the taste off. The service here is good, and the staff is very kind. I've just had better ramen elsewhere in Japantown."

As soon as they opened, there was a huge line that was outside waiting to be seated but the staff here is quick and efficient. When we were seated, we ordered right away and even got our food in a speedy manner.  Now, who doesn't get ramen from a place with ramen in the name? Oops, it's me. Don't get me wrong, ramen is good but give me the option of a rice dish and I'll usually choose that over ramen, any day. When I saw that there was a Chashu bowl on the menu, I knew I had to try it. Now, the two aren't comparable at all with the ramen bowl being significantly bigger than the rice bowl but looking at the price points, it made so much sense. Still, I was satisfied with my choice since it filled me up, regardless of it being a smaller portion. It was good but didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would.  I did also order a matcha which they ended up forgetting about but it was no biggie since I asked them to take it off the bill.  Overall, a good lil spot to grab some food (I'd suggest the ramen, lol) and drinks with friends/family or a date night."

By no means the best fried chicken sandwich ever, but had good flavor - Squash Tempura: this was really delicious - would recommend ordering this. - Popcorn chicken: always a good hit, especially with the yuzu Mayo Miscellaneous: - Indoor dining and outdoor parklet dining available - Typical SF availability for parking - Love that you can have your own tab from the QR code if you want (makes paying the bill easier at the end)"

They just bring the bill back, your card has already been swiped, 20% added, and you can go home. They call it the \"Fair Wage Surcharge\" because it \"allows [them] to provide the staff with a stable and livable wage...\" It is not clear why management does not simply charge prices with which they can provide a \"stable and livable wage\" and leave the tipping to the customers."

Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking bout them. Not sure how I feel about the 'fair wage surcharge in lieu of tipping' - maybe they should be getting a fair wage to begin with?

I came here with a group of friends on a Friday night and it was about an hour long wait for a group of 6, but it was well worth it. The restaurant is pretty small, but the ambiance is super cute and would definitely make for a good date night.  Once we were seated our server was quick to get us started with some drinks and focaccia bread. I don't know if we were all just really hungry or if the bread was that good, but we INHALED the focaccia. Whenever we finished a basket our servers quickly took notice and would give us more without even asking. We literally went through 6 baskets, so if that doesn't say enough about how much we liked the focaccia I don't know what will. Also, pro tip make sure to ask for some balsamic vinegar and oil to dip the bread in!  As for the main course a couple of my friends got pasta (which they absolutely loved) and the rest of us split a few pizzas. We ordered the prosciutto pizza, salsiccia, and the vegana. Just like the bread, we all LOVED all the pizza's. The crust was fresh and crispy and the toppings on all the pizzas were so flavorful. My personal favorite was the prosciutto as I really enjoyed the saltiness of the prosciutto and the creaminess of the burrata.  I would 10/10 come back again and would highly recommend Bottega to anyone looking for a good Italian spot in the area!"

        "BitLeigh V.": "My relationship with Bottega atm is really love hate. I really really wanted to give them a 5, but also just had some issues that made me want to give them a 2. We came to Bottega on a Monday night and waited only a few minutes to be seated. It was pretty busy and a poppin' place for birthdays (there were 3 bday celebrations while we were there). The complimentary focaccia here? Stunning and so plentiful. I definitely killed a whole basket by myself.  Our server was so attentive and helpful! We got the Pomodoro Bruschetta ($10) and Calamari Fritti ($16) to share for our party. Bruschetta very on par and average. Calamari Fritti was so yummy and crispy with the right amount of veggies and a plentiful serving of calamari! What was so weird to me is following our entrees they took all of our small app plates off the table? Mind you, we used utensils for our calamari and our napkin was cloth so it was in your lap. We were then left to have our utensils directly on the table. If the servers took our plates AND utensils, then gave us a new set for dinner set out sure? But I'm a believer of utensils not touching a dining table directly regardless if it's a clean table or not. In addition, a server came by to wipe crumbs off our table between appetizer and entree?? This was really unexpected given the casual vibe of this place and I didn't really like it as our utensils are on the table and I don't know where your dish cloth has been. Upscale dining I've seen this, but not at a Monday night pasta dinner.  There was a water vessel on our table to refill our waters and it had a cork in it. Refilling my water I would notice how dirty the lip of the bottle was due to the cork. It was honestly so so gross and would better be left without using those dirty corks. I didn't want to cause a fuss as our server was so nice, but our server went to refill our water vessel and he never even noticed how grimy it was and gave us back the same one. Yikes. I ordered the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with the server recommended pink sauce (odd name I know) ($23) and my boyfriend ordered the Lasagna ($20).  Everyone's entrees came out at the same time except mine, but our server and the manager came out to apologize and even brought our table a whole round of free NA drinks! No complaints here and they definitely all aim to please. Servers will come around asking if you want parmesan for your entree. There is a big black peppercorn grinder that is humongous, but that server never came by and I def wanted it to make an appearance.  Once my food came out, it was delicious. Honestly so yummy and all I added was some crushed red chili flakes for some spice (they'll bring out calabrian chilies and crushed red pepper for you). I have no bad words about this dish. My boyfriend enjoyed his lasagna, but really I'm glad I didn't get it. It had really no flavor to me, but it was extremely meaty.  To finish off, we ordered two desserts: Chocolate Mousse Cake ($10) and Tiramisu ($10). Chocolate mousse cake was good, but very very average like something that was definitely store bought. The tiramisu definitely was not giving tiramisu. The lady fingers were not soaked enough and were incredibly dry, no coffee taste whatsoever, and just not it. For what it was, however, it was pretty okay just not a tiramisu.  All in all, food at Bottega I loved. The dirty water vessel and crumb wiping was just not it for me."

We came here on a Friday night and the wait was about an hour, suggest adding your name to the Yelp waitlist online to time your arrival based on the estimated wait. Our group of four got a bottle of their delightful merlot and thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes we ordered, including the pesto gnocchi, truffle porcini ravioli, fettuccine alfredo, and funghi bruschetta. The food was creamy, flavorful, and satisfying, highly recommend getting the freshly ground pepper seasoning to enhance flavors. The giant pepper mill they brought out was a fun touch. The service however fell short during our dining experience, and towards the end, we felt rushed. Overall an establishment with good food and lively atmosphere, I see myself going back."

        "Vijay N.": "After having Bottega on my radar for a while (through personal interest and seeing the giant pepper mill on Tiktok), I decided I'd finally pop in to check it out. My girlfriend and I went here for dinner last night around 7 PM - the restaurant was fairly crowded but they had several tables open still so we were promptly brought to our table.  When you walk in there's a main dining area, but there is also seating in the back as well as outdoor seating. The main dining area was a little more cramped and close quarters for my liking but it wasn't uncomfortable at all. The interior was also very cute - the pink theme along with the exposed brick walls and high ceiling was really fun. Service was also very prompt - within a few minutes of getting seated, we were asked for our drink orders along with our appetizer as well. For drinks, I ordered Whisper which was a gin and pineapple cocktail and my girlfriend ordered the Paradoxe. Both cocktails were very delicious - and if it's any indication of what the rest of the cocktails are like I'd highly suggest this as a spot for drinks if you can go. For food, my girlfriend and I decided to lean in and go with a \"truffle\" themed dinner So we got the : *Chrochette di Verdure (Veggie Croquettes) - Perfectly cheesy and paired very nicely with the truffle sauce. *Build your own Pasta with Fettucine and black truffle cream - The black truffle cream sauce was rich without being overwhelming. With the addition of the Calabrian chili/ chili flake on the side, this was super solid. *Tartufata Pizza - Mushrooms, truffle, and cheese.... need I say more. This was a highlight for me. As food was served, we obviously got to enjoy the giant pepper mill - definitely a gimmick but a fun one at that. My only complaint about the meal if anything was that I found the food (notably the croquettes and pasta) was served warm rather than hot. The food was clearly fresh and tasted great but the temperature of the food was a little off for me. That aside, Bottega is a very fun restaurant with great drinks and solid quality Italian food in the Mission. Perfect for a date night or a mid-week meal. Would definitely recommend giving this place a go."

      {
        "Rachel H.": "Lively atmosphere, beautiful decor, and the largest pepper mill on record!  Bottega is an attractive spot and a nice place for a celebration. If you tell them you are celebrating, the staff appears at the end the meal with a large slice of classic tiramisu with a lit candle, singing and clapping. This happened at almost every table on the Friday night we were there, making for quite a celebration, and yes, we were also there for a birthday. Bottega has a gorgeous bar in the center of the restaurant. It's a good spot to grab a classic Aperol spritz and some Italian appetizers like crocchette, brushcetta or carciofi alla giudia (Roman fried artichokes). The pasta dishes are a-okay: the sachetti is particularly good. The burrata dish was pretty, but the tomatoes were out of season. Our waiter was friendly and fun. The timing was off in the kitchen the night we visited and music is energetic and loud, making for loud acoustics and potentially boisterous fun. By all means, get the fresh pepper on every dish! The pepper mill is hilariously large and heavy, the waiter pointing to his biceps as he turned it, and I couldn't help but think of Adam Sandler's pepper boy skit, while he ground fresh-e pepper into my pasta."

        "Luciano Z.": "I had a really nice birthday dinner here and honestly would come back again. It tends to get packed and currently there are no reservations so try to get there early. The restaurant is super bright inside and well decorated which elevated my dining experience. I saw everyone around me with colorful drinks so I had to try one as well. I tried the gossip martini which was more on the sweeter side since it had blue curaao. I thought it was really tasty and refreshing.  For appetizers we tried mozzarella in carrozza and the calamari fritti. I thought the friend calamari had more flavor than the fried mozzarella so I'd probably go for that again. It comes with plenty to share with the table and they also give you complementary foccacia bread. So be prepared so you aren't stuffed before your food gets there.  My main course was the mezzemaniche boscaiola (a rigatoni dish) with their pink sauce. It was so yummy! The pasta was cooked al dente and I liked that about it. I'd definitely get this again. If it's your first time you have to try the pastas! We ended with the tiramisu for dessert and it was heavenly."

It's a great option for a weeknight burger and fries, but the star for me is when you have a weeknight pizza craving. The bacon pizza is so scrumptious. The crispy crust with melty cheese and crisp bacon is a combo to salivate over. The arugula adds a nice peppery touch.  This specific night I decided to try the Toffee Cake, and added a scoop of the seasonal ice cream, which was the Chocolate Caramel Crackle--the two together was AMAZING. I'm going back just for that dessert combo."

Food: Challah French Toast - great sweet brunch option, two large slices of custardy french toast serve with strawberry conserve, mascarpone and pistachios, not too sweet and surprisingly light definitely worth ordering if you're looking for something sweet Butternut squash pizza - a really interesting combo of flavors, base was a pesto along with black garlic, ricotta salata, pepitas and butternut squash, crust was good, crisp and chewy, a bit on the greasy end but over pretty tasty  Bibb lettuce salad - tasty, salad was probably dressed, and well seasoned, bacon was crisp, chicken was well grilled, overall a very good classic salad Fries - thin and fried crisp, my preferred style, can't go wrong, thoroughly enjoyed the trio of sauces that came with them  Service was good, no complaints, were offered water and coffee refills when needed.  Overall one of my favorite spots in the city for an affordable brunch or dinner.

There are not many rooftop restaurants or bars in SF, so keep this in mind when planning to visit this place. This restaurant gets busy! Especially on a sunny day or a game day. They are walking distance to Oracle Park. This is a great place to meet friends or go on a date. Perfect for small bites, cocktails, and a nice city view!  They have a great espresso martini and friends of mine have mentioned they enjoyed their pisco sours.  If you are vegan, they have the following vegan sushi roll options: Nasamurai Roll & Kabocha Roll. & if you are vegetarian, they offer the Union Street Roll, which I like to order, in addition to non-vegetarian options such as their Lima Roll, Kaiyo Roll, and Lomo Saltado Roll."

You get a gorgeous view of the high rises and if you go a little further you can even see the Bay bridge. The whole rooftop has this Peruvian Japanese influenced decor that is so inviting! The outdoor heaters are a plus and needed.  DRINKS: We started off with drinks, I decided to get an old fashion. Our server Ana (she is so sweet) recommend that I switch the whiskey with a Japanese whiskey called \"kikori\". I liked her ask and am glad i went with it, my old fashion was now a Japanese old fashion. Tasted so good! My friend got a pisco sour (a favorite in Peru) and also loved it. In short drinks were expensive but good as you get an ethnic twist on your palate.  FOOD: We ordered three sushi rolls. Lima roll, Kaiyo roll, and Kame house roll. All three rolls come in 8 pieces. Each roll has a generous portion of protein with a small portion of carbs. Which IMO is good, I like how the rice was made as well, Almost like sticky rice, it tasted like brown rice but it wasn't. KAIYO ROLL: Canadian Red Crab/Salmon LIMA ROLL: Shrimp tempura/yellowtail KAME ROLL: Hamachi Of the three rolls our favorite is the KAME roll, as this roll resembles Peruvian's famous ceviche but in sushi form! The sushi is served with their house tiger leche (milk)! Unique flavors. Def my new fav sushi roll!  Overall I give this place a 5/5. I will include pics. Will come back.

To top it off, I brought a party of 6 and the heaters were not working above us so everyone was freezing and there was nothing they could do about it so we ate our apps and drank as fast as we could so we could find a warmer place. Besides our server, the rest of the staff are wonderful and accommodating. The mixologists are experienced and know how to make a tasty cocktail. The hosts are always welcoming. I hope this server finds a new career because awful service really does put an bad taste in your mouth and ruins the experience. I felt embarrassed bringing my friends here after how poorly we were treated by that server and stuck in the cold. Will never eat here again, only cocktails. Cow Hollow is a much better experience as far as servers and they have a larger menu."

It was a nicely balanced plate, but I wish there were some more veggies.  The interior is cute and homey feeling. The staff was pretty nice as well. I did wait almost 40 minutes for the chicken, but after I asked about it, it came out right away."

        "D L.": "I'd always wanted to try this place, as it would grab my attention during the N Judah ride home from work. Today, I finally had the chance to go, and I've gotta say: I'm not impressed.  After going through the Yelp reviews/pictures that highlighted dishes, I ordered the Baked Halloumi and the Beef Kabob Plate. The Halloumi came out first and I could immediately see that it was dry. In fact, I took one bite and felt like I was chewing on rubber bands. I could even hear the cheese squeaking against my teeth with each chew -- no joke. There were enjoyable mild hints of jalapeno and lemon, but overall -- it wasn't good. After eating one of the three pieces, I left the rest aside and received the Beef Kabob Plate. The rice was very good -- fluffy and perfectly made. The roasted cherry tomatoes had this kick of flavor that made me wanting more. And the hummus was excellent, although they only gave two very small pieces of pita bread. As for the beef? Well... the portion was small when comparing it to other places that usually give you 2 whole skewers. This was about 1 skewer's worth -- three pieces the size of your thumb. I took one bite, and although it was seasoned well, it was also quite dry and full of fatty pieces. There was so many strings of fat that I had to strategically chew so none of it would get stuck between my teeth. Unfortunately, a big piece of fat got lodged between my back molars and my meal was ruined. I did my best to ignore it, finished the meal, and then rushed home to grab a toothpick and dislodge the beef fat from between my teeth. In conclusion, I paid ~$50 for erasers and low-grade beef (fat). Yeah... definitely won't be back."

Personally the dip that came with the falafel could have been a little better so that's the only small critique. The staff was Uber friendly and got us seated right away, the restaurant itself was quite busy but the food was very quick to come out. I would highly recommend others to check it out!"

We visited a few weeks back and this time was no different. This was our first time at this specific location in Cole Valley and we had a delicious meal outdoors on a beautiful sunny day (and watched the iconic N muni pass by a couple times) You place your order inside at the counter and they bring the food out to your table. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu, this time we went with the shakshuka, chicken shish tawook plate and beef kabob plate for lunch. The shakshuka is cooked in a cast iron pan and is lightly spiced. The meat in the plates is tender and the rice is so flavorful. The hummus, pita, pickled vegetables work so well. Staff is friendly and welcoming. All in all a great place to enjoy a delicious meal."

        "Kris R.": "I came to Beit Rima based on a recommendation from a friend, and I was glad I did. This Middle Eastern restaurant has an inviting atmosphere and an amazing selection of dishes. We started off with the lamb kibbeh, which was crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside. The combination of spices and tender meat made this dish an instant hit. Next, we tried the shakshuka and it did not disappoint. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the tomato sauce was rich and flavorful. The dish was served with warm pita bread which was the perfect accompaniment. I loved how the dish was simple yet packed with so much flavor. Moving on to the main course, I ordered the chicken shawarma plate. The chicken was marinated in a blend of spices and roasted to perfection. The plate came with a side of rice, hummus, and tabbouleh salad which all complemented the chicken beautifully. The portions were generous and the food was so good that I couldn't stop myself from overeating. I also have to mention the excellent service that I received at Beit Rima. The staff was friendly and attentive, always making sure that I had everything I needed. They were knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations. It's always a pleasure to dine at a restaurant where the staff is just as amazing as the food. Overall, my experience at Beit Rima was amazing. The food was outstanding, the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was inviting. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Middle Eastern cuisine or anyone who is looking for a new restaurant to try. You won't be disappointed!"

Get this!! everything about it is perfect, from chicken to the hummus & rice and the pickeled vegetables! i love the pickled vegetables.

The restaurant is open seating, so you have the choice of picking the table of your preference. You place all your food orders at the register and wait for the server to deliver your food to the table.  We ordered the batata harra and the chicken shish tawook plate, and both dishes were phenomenal! The potato's in the batata harra were covered in cilantro and spices and were soft in the middle with a slightly crispy skin. It was a nice dish to share amongst a party of two! The chicken shish tawook plate came with 3 chicken skewers, a serving of hummus, two pieces of pita bread, and some assorted pickled vegetables on a bed of rice. The chicken was so tender and juicy with great flavors!  The servers were all extremely friendly and we felt welcomed the moment we entered the restaurant! Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for fresh Arabic food in Cole Valley."

        "Sam K.": "We have recommended Beit Rima as our favorite Mediterranean restaurant in SF since before the pandemic. So this incident was disappointing.  We had family visiting and I ordered several items from their website. Since the hand bread was not available at Church st, I decided to gamble and order from Carl St: Couple Mezze sampler, Beef Kabob Plate, Chicken Shishtawook Plate, Hand Breads, Ful and the incredible Batata Harra. Pickup was a pain since it involved driving an additional 15 minutes, but the food is worth it. Long story short, the person picking up returns home and we find the Batara Hara missing. Bummer since I had talked it up to the visiting family, but it happens when the kitchen is busy. What was unexpected was getting a refund is a pain. I shot off an email to the 2 emails which confirmed the order with images, and then to another email suggested on the website, however after over a week no response!  The food is stellar, but the quantity isn't as generous as it used to be. While the prices are up as much as 20-25%. Inflation sucks.  Not sure if Samir is aware that the Carl st crew may be running thin that they struggle to process a refund for missing items, or that items are missing in the first place. Bottomline, I will not order from Carl st again, and stick to Church st, and since the prices are a little crazy, save the orders for really special occasions."

The ambiance was lovely, with a beautiful decor and a cozy atmosphere. We started off with the summer rolls and the crispy fried tofu, both of which were fresh and delicious. For the main course, I had the beef pho with a side of sriracha and hoisin sauce, while my partner had the lemongrass chicken with a side of rice. Both dishes were flavorful and packed with authentic Vietnamese flavors. The service was also excellent, with the staff being friendly and attentive.

        "Mike C.": "Run, don't walk. Or maybe walk quickly since there's only two days left for SF Restaurant week's promotion. I came here today on a whim, wanting to catch up with the chef who I often bump into at the Ferry farmer's market. Getting here around 12:15 pm on a Friday afternoon, I found most tables were occupied and, dining solo, I chose to sit at a counter seat. Sarah greeted and seated me after bumping into chef Rob outside. After weighing the various options, drink, appetizer, and main, I ordered my meal. Sarah helped me in deciding on my main. The restaurant week promotion is $30 for your choice of beverage, appetizer, and main (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=a1y8iDhD72wwMddxFqc6Ww&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot</a>). Here's what I tried: Drink 1. Saigon iced tea (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HTlt3UIc0VlnGX9gtelxSw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot</a>) - Lemongrass, lychee, goji berry, yuzu honey, and mint. I picked this since the other non alcoholic drinks had yogurt likely making them on the creamy side. This was refreshing and not too sweet. Be sure to stir from the bottom. Appetizer 2. Ginger chicken noodle soup (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tf5RKUtVkS6Rnd1_S94rRQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot</a>) - Poached breast and thigh, Thai basil, and bean sprouts. The surprise ingredient here were the cruller (fried dough pieces mostly accompanying porridge) which gave this a crunch element. I commented to Sarah this is an elevated mom's chicken soup. Main 3. Roast beef pho dip sandwich, $5 supplement (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=y-97xkg1Q7ndJnRrT8ts6A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot</a>) - Five spice roasted beef, pate, shallot aioli, and pho au jus. I've had this before and it was as good as remember with the portions larger than I remember. I only finished half of the sandwich and 'jus'/broth with a few bites of the salad. The rest went home for a future weekend meal. Bonus, comped by the generous chef 4. Spicy orange and rice paper salad (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cR_ZtT7NA_oLaWAAX3dV9Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot</a>) - Brokaw avocado, tomato sambal, and Nuoc Cham. The chef brought this out like an amuse bouche mentioning the growers' names along with the ingredients (cara cara oranges and watercress). I jokingly asked him to write it down so I could Yelp it. I later looked at my menu photo in identifying this dish. Get this. If you like spicy, yes I mean spicy, and refreshing sweetness, you'll love this. Was tempted to face plant the bowl to catch every last drop of the sauces. There were three other diners on the front counter with me but we were well socially distanced. As I finished my meal, a flow of diners entered and were seated including a large table towards the back. I didn't get an opportunity to catch up with him given the crowd. I, in passing, kidded him that I liked it better when I was dining alone for lunch, during the pandemic peak. I deliberately posted this now to share this with interested eaters who would like to try this meal as there's only two days left in restaurant week. Just go!"

        "Raymond F.": "Leaving an updated review where I previously praised and said it is 5 stars. I've been here many times and I think the food and the service is truly worth 5 stars. However, my table last night was sat near the door where it was left open due to some restaurant policy. Everyone in my group was cold, especially me and another friend sat right in the way of the door. I requested the door to be closed, but the hostess said it's not possible because it's too hot in the back.  So, without any compromise, the door remained opened and it was really cold. The draft was noticeably heavy and even with my jacket on and it was colder than actually being outside due to the wind tunnel effect happening.  I don't think I would come here again if I had to be sat at that table by the door. If it's too hot in the back or in the kitchen, then perhaps this restaurant needs to look into improving ventilation."

They were VERY busy but we seemed to be the only party that had to stand around and wait for a table to open up. Kind of left a bad taste in the mouth. The food was decently good! The strawberry sinh to was a nice creamy smoothie that satisfied my sweet cravings. My table tried all the appetizers, and I would pass on the salad. The pho and calamari were good though! For my entree I got the cha ca la vong fish noodle bowl and I really liked it. The fish was perfectly crispy and they really loaded the bowl with a LOT of fish. Overall, $30 restaurant week deal was well worth it for the yummy food and the huge portion sizes."

Would just bus or Uber honestly bc we spent 20 mins finding parking and another 15 to walk. Wish they had let us known ahead but oh well! Prefix was 30 pp but our entrees were +5 each  Got the prefix menu for restaurant week which lets u choose btw drink, app, entree  Saigon ice: 3/5 the yuzu was settled in the bottom so make sure to mix well! Strawberry sin toh: 2/5 tastes like the children strawberry yogurt drink (danimals) haha Calamari: 3.5/5 this was ok! Appreciated the fish sauce/Asian flavors but maybe a bit bland bc lack of enough sauce Chicken noodle soup: 4/5 this was a miniature pho dish basically and broth was pretty good with taste of chicken stock  Broken rice: 5/5 generous portion and all the individual pieces tasted really good. The broth this dish came out in was the best bc it had a beef stock taste with rich flavors Pho dip: 3/5 wasn't my favorite a lot of meat and pate but maybe wasn't as spicy as I had hoped to balance those flavors. Also the dip thing maybe wasn't too much of a fan of but can see why others may like!  Overall we paid around 46 after tax and tip which I think was a bit pricey but still had pretty generous portion sizes. Not sure if I may visit again but if I do excited to explore the dinner menu!"

        "Maria V.": "I made a reservation for a party of 6 a few months in advance for brunch on a Saturday. The online reservation system was easy to use and seamless. On the day of our brunch, we were running a little late and they were able to accommodate a reservation at 12:00 PM rather than 11:30 AM which was nice. (Note: They open at 11:00 AM). The place did not get busy until 1-1:30 PM, so if you do plan on having a later brunch, do make a reservation.  Each of us ordered from the prix fixe brunch menu which was a base price of $35/person. The prix fixe menu allows you to choose a drink, appetizer, and an entree. However, there are supplemental and add-ons which can easily hike the price of $35/person closer to $50-$60/person before tax. I got the coconut smoothie and added a shot of rum ($5 added for the coconut smoothie and an additional $7 to add alcohol to any drink), fried calamari, and the broken rice fish (com tam). My husband got the Saigon tea, papaya mango salad, and the BBQ heritage bowl.  Coconut sinh to (3/5) - The presentation for this drink was great as it reminded me of Hawaii, but the drink itself was not remarkable. It tasted like bland coconut milk rather than a pia colada smoothie.  Saigon tea (3/5) - We were hoping the yuzu flavor in the tea would pull through, but the drink was a bit too floral for our tasting. A plus about this drink is it's not sweet, but do make sure to mix your drink thoroughly before drinking it or it gets syrupy on the bottom.  Fried calamari (4/5) - Out of the 3 choices for appetizers on the menu, this was most likely the best choice. The calamari was lightly fried with some peppers. An aioli was drizzled on top of it. It was great, but just also a bit on the bland side even with the aioli topped on.  Papaya mango salad (1/5) - We get that aesthetics are key in making and plating dishes, but this salad just had too many edible flowers and veered too far from what a salad should be. The papaya and mango are thinly sliced into thick 0.5\" strips rather than in matchsticks. Everyone in our party who ordered this dish ate around the flowers and was left with half a plate of flowers. The flowers were simply too overwhelming. The pomegranate was a nice touch, but again everything was buried in flowers making it hard to truly enjoy.  Com tam (3/5) - The broken rice fish came with a great selection of protein from shrimp to chicken to pork. It also had a sunny side up fried egg present. Having some fish sauce on the side would be nice, but the protein for this dish was overly salty. Items were cooked well, but the flavoring was not to our palette.  BBQ bowl (3/5) - This dish had banh hoi (rice noodles) and grilled pork. Pork was fine, but nothing surprised us about the dish.  All in all, we felt this was on the pricey side, but of course it's in SF so we knew right off the bat that we would be paying more. Presentation for the food was well executed, but the flavors were hard to follow through. We are glad we tried Lily restaurant.  The service was amazing and our server was very approachable."

From start to finish, my experience was nothing short of exceptional. First and foremost, the staff (Bren, Steven, Brandon, and Justin) at The Tailor's Son is incredible. They are warm, welcoming, and attentive from the moment I stepped through the door; I felt like I was being taken care of by old friends, rather than mere restaurant staff. I was also pleased to note that the GMs (Collin) and senior management were very respectful, which is always a good sign of a well-run establishment. It was clear that they take pride in their restaurant and want to ensure that their guests have the best possible experience. But let's talk about the food and drink. The wine selection at The Tailor's Son is nothing short of extravagant. I learned that most of their wine comes from the brilliant mind of a SOM from a16, and it certainly shows in the quality and variety on offer. The wine list is extensive and varied, with options to suit all tastes and budgets. The atmosphere at The Tailor's Son is impeccable. It's the perfect combination of elegance and warmth, with cozy lighting and tasteful decor. I felt comfortable and at ease throughout my meal, which made for a truly enjoyable dining experience. But what really stood out to me was the way that The Tailor's Son treats its guests. They don't treat anyone like a number; instead, everyone is cared for in great detail. From the personalized service to the thoughtful touches throughout the meal, it is clear that the staff at The Tailor's Son takes pride in providing a truly exceptional dining experience. Overall, I would highly recommend The Tailor's Son to anyone looking for an unforgettable dining experience in San Francisco. With incredible staff, an extravagant wine selection, an impeccable atmosphere, and a genuine focus on caring for its guests, this is a restaurant that truly stands out from the crowd. I am very disappointed I won't be able to visit again I'm moving to Denver by the end of the month.  All Love, Dan O'Holleran"

        "Harrison H.": "A good Italian restaurant is hard to come by, in my frank opinion. But The Tailor's Son just knocks it out of the park and squashes and preconceived notions I had about Italian restaurants. This establishment has extremely flavorful food that stays true to it's Italian roots but adds an almost New America twist.  You HAVE to get the Burrata Crostini. All the reviews here are not lying. The star of the dish IS THE BREAD. So warm, soft and crispy that holds the creamy burrata perfectly. The pickled green tomatoes and asparagus add the perfect texture and acidity all well rounded dishes have. For our mains, we order the Agnolotti and Risotto Alla Milanese. BOTH EQUALLY AS SCRUMPTIOUS. The agnolotti bursts with flavor and is coated is a light but flavorful sauce. Finally, the risotto. How would I describe it? Creamy. Al dente. And a solid dish of risotto. Is super unique? No. But is it full of flavor and meshes perfectly with the ossobucco? Yes! So what about the ambiance and service? I'll be honest...it's a bit loud in here. I could still hear my friend talking across from me (albeit with a bit of shouting) but this is not one of the establishments you come for an intimate dinner. It's definitely a vibe. Service was excellent as well. It was the right balance of making sure we had everything we needed but not being overbearing.

My friend had moved from Dallas to Santa Rosa and had heard about so many good things regarding The Tailor's Son. We finally decided to try the place during an overnight trip to the city. Before heading out to our concert, we decided to grab a bite at The Tailor's Son after scouting the menu and deciding that the items would fill us up.  We ordered a few appetizers and main dishes (the pasta was so fulfilling). We left very happy. The place gets super packed with people. Luckily we were able to grab seats at the bar and enjoy the view with the mirrors reflection. Our bartender paid us as much attention as he could as we were hidden behind one of the bar dispensers. The food was prompt so that made up for the delay on drinks and water refills.  The area really is lovely and we highly suggest the area and The Tailor's Son. Walkable distance from many night life events but if you prefer grabbing a ride, no shame in it, especially when it's cold out."

They were a bit dry once I finished all the toppings, so would have liked a bit more compote or greek yogurt. The eggs had a really nice soft scrambled texture, although the sausage was a bit dry and the eggs slightly bland in taste. Overall though, a great, well balanced brunch :)"

        "Lisa C.": "We went to Lokma on a Saturday evening at 8:00 pm and only had a 10 minute wait. The place steadily busy. Fortunately, they had outdoor seating with excellent heaters. The service was prompt and friendly.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the wine. It was an organic biodynamic made cabernet sauvignon wine. It was very good.  We ordered the sauces, beet salad, Braised Short Rib, Karniyarik, and, Turkish Dumplings Meatballs--family style for 4 of us. The ribs ribs were tender and seasoned and braised perfectly. The dumplings were also perfectly done and I loved the tanginess of the sauce which complemented the meat. The karniyarak was tasty, but not my favorite. My daughter really loved it. This amount of food was just the right amount for the 4 of us.  The next time we go, we will have to have the Branzino! It looked so yummy and I noticed it was a popular dish."

I grabbed some McD with all those reviews, turned out it's enough for 3, except probably some more pita. There are many comments about the \"smallish\" size of this dish, it's actually the most fulfilling and about the best they offer, I mean, if 16 pitas can fill you up ... Fresh fruits are great with breakfast, and we all like the pastes (yogurt, hummus, and tomato?). For additional dishes are pretty average though, we ordered pancake, Turkish sausage and potatoes, that should have been ordered in McD instead."

        "Cece L.": "My group and I had never had Turkish breakfast before, so we wanted to try a little of everything. We did family style, which I'd highly recommend. The four of us split the Turkish Breakfast for Two, Greek Yogurt Pancakes, and the Turlu Omelette. The first two are must-tries. The omelette was good too, but could swap that out for something else. The Turkish Breakfast (5/5) was super fun to eat, with many different flavors and textures we'd never had before. We especially liked the hazelnut spread. The Greek Yogurt Pancakes (5/5) were amazingly soft and fluffy, and unique with the yogurt flavor.  The Turlu Omelette was really good as well (4.5/5) but more standard to me. Would love to come back to try more."

        "Avani V.": "One of the most memorable meals I've had in a while! Came in for Sunday brunch- make sure to make use of the Yelp waitlist because the wait is hefty.  My group of four ordered the Turkish breakfast for two, the Turlu omelet, and the Greek yogurt pancakes to share, family style.  I would easily give each of these dishes a 5/5 rating.  The Turkish breakfast is perfect for splitting with your group, as there's something in it for everyone. The muhummara (red pepper dip), and the hazelnut spread were the standouts. Eating the Turkish dips and sides alongside the eggs was really delightful; it gave a unique spin on a typical run-of-the-mill brunch dish. Also worth noting that they agreed to serve the sausage on the side to make the eggs vegetarian for me!  The Turlu omelet was also a fantastic dish. My vegetarian heart rejoiced upon seeing the hefty serving of veggies in the omelet. The crispy potatoes on the side were also great. Again, this was a great cultural twist on a breakfast staple.  Capping off our meal with the Greek yogurt pancakes was a brilliant move on our part. Such a great sweet dish because it isn't too sweet! The yogurt and fresh fruit add so many great flavors that balance the sweetness.  The amount of food we ordered was absolutely perfect for the four of us, and the total came out to just north of $20 each including tax and tip. Fantastic value for the quality and quantity of food we were served."

It was cooked perfectly soft and made for an excellent brunch."

While the Manti and Short Rib were great, my favorites were actually the two appetizers. Portions were reasonable for the prices (by SF standards, anyway), service was friendly and efficient, and the interior was cozy.  Next on the list will be to re-visit for brunch!"

And I gotta say, my partner and I were pleasantly impressed. It's good for what it is, this isn't your homestyle/street food type mexican food. This is your \"fancy resort in mexico type\" and for that, it is good. Especially paired with their well made cocktails, thats a win.  In terms of food, I recommend the beef tacos. Its not dry and has lots of flavors, ask for their habanero hot sauce if you wanna kick it up a notch. Their al pastor tacos were fine, it didn't have the classic red char but it wasn't bad.  Drinks are dangerously good though, if you like mezcal, this is the place to try it. I liked my Paloma and my partner enjoyed his old fashion (i forget the actual name)."

        "Erin J.": "This place was very good! Not like mind blowingly good or anything like that, but a solid Mexican brunch place.  Came here today with my sister and brother in law, and their pup Bailey. They have outdoor seating and it wasn't cold out (rarity in SF this winter) so it worked out perfectly.  We got some chips and salsa, and I got the beef hash. My sister got the beef tacos and my brother in law got the pozole. The chips and salsa were great - only thing that could have made them better was warm chips but who cares. The salsa was certainly house made, very good kick, and surprisingly the salsa verde was a bit hotter than the rojo.  My hash was nothing to write home about honestly but what can you expect, its potato, veggies and cut up beef. I guess the beef just wasn't that flavorful (didn't seem to have really any Mexican flavor to it - cumin, etc.), or tender. But it was still a solid dish. The eggs were perfectly poached with a nice orange yolk. I also tried the beef tacos and those were yummy, though my sister thought they were spicy. Brother in law loved his pozole.  Will probably be back again because it is close by, wasn't busy and the service was good!"

In our case, this was a positive but mind the spice if you're not as big of a fan. It was just the perfect thing to wake our palettes up. Also as a bonus, the portion size was bigger than I expected.  For entree, we shared the mushroom tacos and beef tacos which were a great compliment to each other. The mushroom tacos were also a bit spicy but you can ask for them without the chili flakes on top which would moderate the heat. All the dishes were super savory and delicious.  The service was excellent and our waitress spent time with us walking through some dishes that would be perfect for the level of appetite we were at.  I look forward to coming back with an even bigger group because the tapas format lends itself really well to sharing."

In terms of the food, they do vegetables here very very well. The charred cabbage and roasted Brussel sprouts were flavorful. Each bite has the right balances of umami, salt, acid, and heat. The cod tostada was skillfully executed to preserve the fish (without going dry), keep a crunch on the tostada, yet round out the flavor profile. I had a margarita that evening and it had acidity that was delightful. It also was not heavy handed with the tequila and was balanced well.  The service here is attentive without being pushy or overbearing. I thought they handed our party of seven well, and we never felt like there was a significant gap for plates to come out. Overall, I will be back!"

The mushroom tacos were full of umami and well-balanced, though on the mushy side if you care about textures. Everything tasted fresh and made with quality ingredients. The drinks were solid and positively cheap at $12 a pop. Service was great, and the vibe inside was great for a casual-ish date.  Did this place stand out among the many great Mexican/taco places in the city? Not really. But I didn't try their meat tacos, so maybe that would've made the difference!"

It was very classy inside and the view of the harbor made it pleasant to eat.  We started off with appetizers. We ordered the crispy calamari ($17) and 1/2 dozen oysters ($24). After ordering the appetizers, we were given the complementary sour dough bread and butter. The bread was warm and the butter was creamy and easy to spread on the bread. We ordered linguini and clam pasta ($25) to share. Lastly, we ordered the clam chowder in the sour bread bowl ($14). The chowder came out first. It tasted great and I would recommend getting it with the bread for both the taste and the looks! The calamari was next and it was very crispy. The calamari sauce had a nice hint or garlic which was delicious. The pasta came out shortly after and you can taste the butter garlic and tomato sauce in every bite. The clams were small but there was lots on the plate. The garlic break was also a nice touch. Overall, good food and service. It's always busy but the staff work fast to get people to enjoy their food and leave feeling good. Definitely worth trying the clam chowder in the bread bowl if it's your first time eating here as well."

The crab cakes and Fried Calamari were awesome apps. Enough to share if you get both.  I tried the Mixed Grill. The sauce really made the dish and it was nice to try three fish varieties. My go to is the clam chowder in a bread bowl. Hard to beat but I was feeling adventurous. I'd recommend both. They do being you a sourdough role, so even if you don't get the bread bowl you can sample the bread while you're here"

The restaurant's waterfront location provided stunning views, and the seafood dishes were fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. One minor downside to the experience, however, was the temperature inside the restaurant. It was quite cold, which detracted a bit from the overall enjoyment of the meal. However, this was a minor issue and did not significantly impact my overall impression of the restaurant. Despite the cold temperature, the service was excellent.

Of course I couldn't pass up ending the night with the creme brle. My gripe would probably be with utensils that weren't available or offered. It surprises me that they don't have seafood picks. I asked and there was a shell cracker and a seafood fork only. It was a bit messy but I made it work."

The cream of the mussel fries were not that tasty, and the some of the mussel shells were cracked. The lobster roll came with fries and I was not impressed. The clam chowder was nice and hot as I opened the bread cover the smoke came out, but once I tasted it the flavor wasn't as great as I expected it. Maybe I was expecting more as this is suppose to be the best clam chowder. Nonetheless, it is a really nice restaurant and we had a great time but the food wasn't as good as we thought it would be."

It's a great thing to order along with whatever other fried tapas you might get. - Fried Aki legs: fried octopus with dipping sauce. This was good! pretty standard - Boneless chicken wings with soy garlic sauce: Yum!! Satisfied a week long fried chicken craving. It was super crispy. - Chicken JJim Plate: Cheesy and spicy with lots of chicken and glass noodles. I liked the veggies in here too. - Kuro Ramen: this was not our favorite and a little underwhelming. The noodles were too soft and the flavors were not very strong.

I visited with my friend and we ordered the Boneless Fried Chicken with the honey butter marinade, as well as the Tonkotsu Sesame Ramen and the Bulgogi Plate. Every item was hearty, comforting and delicious. The fried chicken was simple but insanely crispy and juicy -- might truly be one of the best fried chicken dishes I've had. I also really liked the Bulgogi Plate. It's such a solid, balanced, umami dish, and I love the addition of the glass noodles.  I feel like for the amount and the caliber of the food, the prices are very reasonable. We also got hot sake, which was such a good deal!

It's becoming more clear as I come here more times which dishes I am very happy with and which ones less favorable to me. I didn't like my spicy pork plate (first time ordering this here) as more oily and and had a strong butter aftertaste than I want.  None of the appetizers I've ordered to date has disappointed me.

That's why I removed a star. Customer service needs work here Anyway we ordered the crab Louie and it was simply amazing. Super simple but tasty.

The decor is very quaint and fun to look at. The service on the otherhand was ridiculous. You are held prisoner until your server comes around to bring you your check.

We ordered the clam chowder which was delicious, and the Best Damn Crab Cioppino. On the menu it says that it can feed 2, but really it could probably feed 6 people. Between me and my friends, we each had 2 small bowls and there was enough leftovers for dinner! So the cioppino is definitely a must try here and bring friends! The cioppino was filled with clams, mussels, scallops, large meaty crab legs, shrimp, and squid. Such a worth-it bowl of goodness! And my own personal tip, ask for some lemon wedges to splash some lemon juice on top of all that goodness.  The restaurant isn't very large inside so there aren't too many tables inside, but there is a bar to sit at. And if you sit at the bar you might get to see the chefs make your meal since it's an open kitchen:)  Also, since my friends and I were sitting facing the kitchen, we saw a lot of orders of this beautiful steaming pink dish. When we asked what it was, the chefs told us it was a lobster ravioli. So I might give that a try the next time I head over."

        "Claudia S.": "Very old school. Crowded setup. Difficult parking. Things are a bit hectic but the food is good.  Wait is long if you come during mealtime. Otherwise, a nice and fun seafood spot that holds a lot of SF history. I do like bringing people here if they are visiting from out of town. Their cioppino is the best thing on the menu and everything that comes with it is fresh, much more than I can say about some of the other older seafood spots. Not a whole lot of raw options like Swan, but definitely yummy."

        "Sam P.": "Wow! Wow ! Wow ! Despite living in and visiting SF often - I have always wanted to eat at Sotto Mare and finally made it - and it was absolutely worth it! As a party of three, we called ahead and made a reservation which is worth it as it's always packed We were seated immediately and it's such a cool atmosphere with a view of the cook line and perhaps the most chill head chef ever! We went old school with a bottle of house Chianti and began with really good and perfectly shucked oysters and the BEST Carb Louis salad I have ever had - huge amount of crab for a really great price! Then we enjoyed two classic dishes - my daughter had Clams Linguine which was absolutely fantastic and we had their iconic Cioppino which is a must try dish here and amazing!! Definitely worth many visits!!"

        "Sally Y.": "This is one of those places to take friends when they visit San Francisco. Hottest crab cioppino in North Beach, feeds 2-4 depending on appetite.  Sotto Mare opens from 11:30am until late. Bustling fun environment in a neighborhood of great fudge and gelato.  Service is friendly though getting a table or your bill might take awhile. Reservation for 4+ must be made by phone and is highly recommended."

        "Jacqueline M.": "I came here with really high expectations, and left feeling mostly positive about my experience.  I definitely recommend calling the restaurant to get a reservation for an upstairs table. We came at 5 pm without a reservation, and I appreciated that the waitstaff helped us get a last minute table before the later reservations kicked in. (The service is very friendly and attentive.) However, we were seated in the subterranean restaurant level, and I think the lack of natural light/windows combined with the low ceilings and high density seating was kind of off-putting. The upstairs dining area looks festive and fun, and I think it would be preferable to eat there. My dad is a huge cioppino fan, and I was told by friends that I had to bring him to Sotto Mare. He -- of course -- ordered the huge cauldron (pot? vat?) of cioppino. His notes are as follows: - Serving size: Enough for two to three people to share. - Presentation: Fun and refreshing. He had never eaten cioppino from a metal cauldron/pot/vat before. You can request a bib. - Food: Tasty. HOWEVER, he was disappointed that the serving vessel wasn't full of soup, as he expected. The bottom 1/3 to 1/2 of his cauldron consisted of pasta, which expanded and absorbed the cioppino broth as our meal went on. I started off with a side of clam chowder, which was creamy and rich. This dish could be split between two people. I also ordered a fettuccine with smoked salmon. This was a medium sized dish, and I had leftovers to take home with me. The sauce was rich, thick, and creamy. I thought the flavor of the smoked salmon was just right, in that it didn't overpower the alfredo sauce."

        "Aria H.": "I came here with three of my friends on a Saturday night, and it was pretty busy. All of their tables with the charcoal BBQs were full, so they sat us at a different table to wait. We didn't have to wait too long, and the lady helping us was super sweet. I haven't tried Thai BBQ before, so I was excited to try it.  There were two different set menus; the smaller set is meant for 2 people while the bigger one is for 3-4, but one of us wasn't eating so we got the smaller set. We could choose to either decide which meat and seafood we wanted, or to get the chef's choice. We decided on the latter. The set also came with noodles or rice (we got udon noodles) and a plate of veggies.  First they brought out the grill, poured the broth in, and put this little bit of fat on the middle. But they didn't give us tongs or anything and we were left just waiting for like 5 minutes watching the fat just burn on the grill. We were really confused and didn't know what to do, and all the waiters were so busy it was hard to get their attention. It was also frustrating later on when we had to try super hard to ask for our check. It is understandable though because there were a lot of people, and when we were able to get their attention they were very nice.  Finally we did manage to get some tongs and start cooking our food. They had two different kinds of sauces that were both pretty good. The set came with a good variety of meats and seafood, which I liked because we got to try a little bit of everything. It was slightly difficult to cook some of the items because the way the grill was shaped meant they kept falling into the broth, but it was no big deal.  In terms of portions, the set would definitely have been better for two people, but it was still okay for the three of us. For $39, I would say it was a decent price.  Overall, I had a pretty good experience but I'm not sure if I would go back. I would still recommend checking this place out, especially if you haven't had Thai BBQ before."

        "Ansh P.": "Showed up during grand opening week. What distinguishes MuuKaTa6395 is the Thai BBQ focus. I don't believe there's another Thai restaurant with that focus in the Bay Area. Awesome!! But that will take me another visit to review. On this quick lunch stop I went off their standard Thai menu which is also somewhat unique. The do have items like Mama noodles, Khao Kruk Prik Krea (BBQ Chicken or Pork in a seafood sauce) and Yang Hai (BBQd meat over garlic rice along with a seafood sauce). which are all very rare finds.  For my quick lunch meal I went with the Tom Sap Muu. It's an Esan / Northeastern Thai soup with a spicy and sour Tom Yum style broth and braised pork ribs, pork intestines, pork liver, pork stomach, cilantro, green onions. I'd say it was a 4/5. I'm willing to go back and try more items. But I did think the rice was too dry and some of the key ingredients like Galangal and Kaffir Lime were visibly missing.  Will report back and update my rating after sampling a couple more dishes. Service was great and the owners were very appreciative of grand opening business and awareness of their unique menu."

        "Amy L.": "Drove by the other day while running errands and noticed the sign--mookata was one of my favorite places to go and eat while I was in Singapore, and I haven't seen a spot in California yet. Naturally, I decided to come in the very next day. Their IG recommends calling to make a reservation; probably because it gets pretty crowded past 10 PM onwards (the spot is open until 12AM). If you're planning on going in before that though, it's free for now since it's the soft opening. From the get-go, service was super attentive and friendly. The waitress explained how to order and what mookata is, and even asked us how we heard of them. Mookata is basically a 2-in-1 bbq and hotpot set up, where you can grill and cook items in broth at the same time. What I like most about it is the juices from the grill flavor the soup even more. This place uses charcoal under their grills. There are 2 party sets, both of which are chef-customized meat and veggie selections, and you can select up to 2 carb choices per set. You can also order a la carte if you want. We ended up ordering 2 sets that served 3-4 people each, as well as 2 appetizers. The servings are pretty generous. Meat selections include a variety of seafood, chicken, beef, pork, and liver, so it was interesting to sample them in both bbq and hotpot form. The broth had great flavors, although a touch salty. The only thing about it was that we were running low often, and it was difficult to have enough broth on hand to cook things properly.  Overall I think it's great that a mookata place opened up in SF, and it's very authentic. If you're looking for a fun experience with a group of friends, I'd recommend trying it out here!"

        "David K.": "MuuKaTa6395 is a first-of-its-kind restaurant in SF, bringing authentic Thai charcoal BBQ to the city! The Muu Ka Ta set came with a plate of meat and a plate of vegetables to be cooked on a charcoal-fired domed grill surrounded by a ring of broth that captured the juices and fat from the meat. The plate of meats included chicken, rib-eye beef, pork shoulder, bacon, pork belly, pork liver, kurobuta sausage, squid, shrimp, scallop, imitation crab, fish tofu, and fish balls stuffed with roe. The vegetables included sliced king oyster mushrooms, regular cabbage, Napa cabbage, Shanghai bok choy, Chinese celery, carrots, and egg tofu. We also got a Jim Joon set, which came with all of the same items but cooked in a Thai E-Sarn style herbal soup hot pot instead of a grill. The sets also came with a choice of starch, and we got the sticky rice, garlic fried rice, udon, and glass noodles. A highlight was the variety of sauces, which included a seasoned soy sauce, a spicy green chili sauce, a sweet red chili sauce, and chopped raw red chilies/garlic and lime for a real kick. Everything here was tasty, and the service was super friendly and passionate about explaining this unique style of grill and hot pot, whose authentic flavors were transported here from Thailand!"

        "Steven O.": "My experience at Muukata was nothing short of amazing! I visited during the soft opening and I was blown away by the Thai charcoal bbq hotpot combos. My dining companion and I ordered two of these combos and we were extremely impressed by the quality of the ingredients and the flavors that were infused into the hotpot. The meats were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables were fresh and crisp. The broth was rich and savory, and we couldn't get enough! In addition to the hotpot, we also tried the fried Vietnamese sausage and grilled ribeye Thai salad. The sausage was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the Thai salad was a perfect balance of flavors and textures. Both dishes were excellent complements to our main meal. The service at Muukata was also top-notch. Our server was attentive and helpful, and she made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, and we felt right at home. Overall, I would highly recommend Muukata to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic Thai dining experience. The food is outstanding, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Five stars all around!"

        "Richard B.": "Always starting at 5 stars and taking away from each instance: -1 star: From a health and safety point - you should never be \"mixing\" raw meats it's cross contamination, I understand the attempt for presentation however for the safety of the customers this should not be done. We are the side meats to avoid the others that were touching with the chicken.  -1 star: For the place/establishment - the ventilation is very poor and it's as if you're sitting outside in front of a camp fire and standing over it where the smoke is hitting you directly.  -1 star: Now if you want service the girls there don't care and it'll take about 30-45 mins to get your charcoal. Along with another 30 to get the food you cook yourself, you'd think it be sooner since it's similar to kbbq The only ones that are going to check on you will be the busser and the other young guy."

It may be hard to find since there isn't a sign and its pretty dark inside. I love the vibe and decor inside and it is a very spacious space.  Me and my friend came on a Thursday night and it was not busy at all. We were practically the inside only table. We ordered a margarita, plane and simple cocktail, the wagyu steak, and chips and dip from the happy hour menu. Then we ordered some shots as well. Their happy hour menu is so reasonable and it is not too pricey especially the steak. The cocktails and food were amazing! Especially the dip for the chips. Who knew hot sauce in the dip was that good! What a great combo. We were also given Mama Maks Spicy Wontons which I forgot to take a picture if and it was delicious! Bomb wontons!!!

The hollandaise sauce was so airy, light and delicious (and I typically don't like hollandaise sauce)! They said they hand whip it in the back! Makes me want to try all their benedicts just for the hollandaise sauce. Seriously. They were very generous with their champagne, orange and mango juices! I really liked the mango mimosa!  Service was great, but it is a big space so was easy to wave down the servers for bottomless refills! And I was surprised that the height of the sofas to table was perfect for dining and then leaning back to enjoy the mimosas! Also tried my friends' loco moco - the meat gravy and waygu patty was insane. Need to get that next time! And same for the Serious AF burger. Both had runny eggs!

        "Janelle L.": "Super secret location, found with an unmarked storefront at the corner of Taraval & 21st. The decor is super lounge-y with white Asian-ish ceiling lanterns and lights that rotate in color. There is house music played in the background. The host seats you and directs you to order by scanning the QR code pasted on a decorative table light. The barkeep and server mull at the bar until the orders come up. Just an opinion, the server, although friendly needs a little more menu knowledge so she can be helpful.  The menu is smaller we ordered: Chicken Liver Pate - nothing special or extraordinary but a good solid pate with grilled bread. A little compote or chutney might have been a good addition to this. Hmm, maybe even a kimchi chutney or lychee jam or something to keep with the Asian theme.  Chips & Dip - for the life of me I cannot remember what was in it but it was fresh and Mama Mak's Spicy Wontons - A decent sized dish with 10 shrimp (pretty decent sized) wontons in an XO ponzu sauce. Super flavorful with spice that won't kill you.  Chicken & Mushroom Tagliatelle - Mmmm, they use a Maitake and portobello cream sauce. The chicken was not dry! Sounds like a heavy dish but it was surprisingly light.  Kimchi Paella - The kimchi flavor worked surprisingly well in this dish. There were 4 large shrimp sauted in what tasted like Galbi sauce. The BEST decision we made was ordering the wagyu Zabuton add-on. This tasted like it was also marinated in the Galbi sauce. The chef cooked it to perfection. THIS was an excellent piece of meat. Street parking on a Saturday night was surprisingly easy. We found an open spot diagonally across the street intersection"

First, there was Hot Pot Garden, then Prime Steakhouse, and now Best Kept Secret...the owner's best business yet in this space. Trendy lounge with great food...which is rarely, the case with lounges where food tends to be an afterthought.  Don't worry, carniwh*res, they still got the juicy MEATS! And, most importantly? It won't break your wallet. Best Kept Secret is truly a best kept secret as I visited on a quiet, rainy Thursday night which is my preference since I'm allergic to crowds. If you are too, early weeknights are probably the best time to visit.  Rezzie available.  For the covid conscious, staff wore masks and ordering is contactless. M E N U New American with a Korean flair. Think galbi marinated steak and kimchi paella.  Full bar with craft cocktails. Bottle service available.  For NYE, they'll be hosting a party with an OPEN BAR! $100 pp which is a great deal and includes top shelf booze. O R D E R I N G All contactless (including payment) via QR code on table. D R I N K * Grey Goose Shot ($12) Generous pour served over a highball ice which I appreciate. All in the details. F O O D * Chips & Dip w/ housemade crme fraiche, lemongrass, housemade xo sauce ($10): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F5b6fh4nw&s=6f9bf94f52c6d61f6ba701c54dfbe73b251ee0289dd721450adb1ddd3cb30cf2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/5b6fh4nw</a> Love this AZN spin on an American classic snack. The dip was deliciously creamy with a salty, savory, sweet, and smoky umami from the xo sauce (dried seafood based). The kettle chips were thin and crunchy but sturdy enough for scooping.  * Chicken Liver Pt w/ garlic, shallot, Kerrygold butter, levain bread ($12): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F5b6fh4nw&s=6f9bf94f52c6d61f6ba701c54dfbe73b251ee0289dd721450adb1ddd3cb30cf2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/5b6fh4nw</a> Never made it to Prime Steakhouse so I'm glad they kept this on the menu after hearing rave reviews about it. The hype is real! The pt was so smooth, creamy, and flavorful. The Kerrygold buttery added an extra richness. My only suggestion: toast the bread.  * Imperial Wagyu Zabuton Steak, galbi marinated w/ kimchi ($22): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F2dvr3w8a&s=7efb6f9f18be8ab21935b7db1fe8e8836c148073fc72a884bcf53aecca49369a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/2dvr3w8a</a> Perfectly medium rare, tender, and juicy with a savory sweetness from the galbi marinate. The zabuton steak was cooked over charcoal so you get those smoky, caramelized edges. BOMB!  The kimchi's acidity helps cut through bites of beefy goodness.  I know other steakhouses are charging 40-50%+ more for the same cut so this is def one of the best value items in the city! S E R V I C E The owner, Edward and the staff are friendly, gracious, and attentive.  Prompt drink and food service. A M B I A N C E Hip and trendy with color changing lanterns and IG walls for photo ops: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F5n983j39&s=a719d5bafd1c1bccddd4eebc34cae7823066571036eef7055fb795da52b2137f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/5n983j39</a>. It's a HUGE venue that accommodate over 100 people so it's an ideal place for hosting an event...esp with the full bar.  Bar area has several TVs for watching the game. P A R K I N G Like most parts of the city, street parking can be challenging.  Overall, Best Kept Secret is such a welcome addition to The Sets/Parkside. Size alone, there's nothing like this in the area - great for who want that nightlife without having to trek to the DT/FiDi area.  That juicy steak tho, I'll be back for you..."

We ended up getting caught in traffic on the way up, but we called and the restaurant was able to accommodate our lateness. Once we arrived, we were seated at a large table near the back. The space was relatively small but in a cozy and classic way - pretty casual vibes. Our server Jake came over right away and we started off with some drinks - I got an Aperol Spritz (too heavy on the Aperol/light on the Prosecco, but I still enjoyed it) and my friends got the Tidy Tips (very tasty) and Birds Eye (didn't try this one). We also got some starters to share - the Acme Bread & Butter, Chicken Liver Mousse (fantastic), Gulf Prawns (great seasoning but not a whole lot of prawn to eat), Oysters (phenomenal, so fresh), and Roasted Cauliflower (also great, totally exceeded my expectations).  After this, it was time for pasta! I don't know why they don't advertise it anywhere, but Pearl can sub gluten free pasta into any of their pasta dishes. However, it's not even on their menu so I only knew this from the Yelp reviews. I got the gluten free Radiatori and my friends got the Spinach-Ricotta Gnudi, Spaghetti, and Seared Scallops. All the entrees were phenomenal, and I absolutely loved my pasta dish. Portion sizes were also perfect - I finished the entire dish and didn't feel overly full afterwards. We also got Espresso Martinis to finish off the meal, which were pretty good but had a bit too much foam. Overall though, I would LOVE to return!"

I would have told you more about the pasta if I had a chance to get to it. We worked through our appetizers (one of our appetizers never made it to us) and were ready for our pasta. We waited for 45 minutes, our appetite was so dead, I asked the waitress to just pack our food.  I am not someone who judges the situation until I know what went down. So I asked our server if everything was ok and told her about our experience. She responded in an unapologetic tone, \"I would have gotten your olives if you had reminded me\". I said I wasn't sure if I want to come back to this place after the experience I was having and she responded- \"that's your choice\". I had never hear that before.  By the end of our conversation I was an asshole and all the staff knew about it. The news spread like wildfire and got the stare from all the staff. When I paid the bill and did leave a tip even after the terrible experience, the staff members just grabbed the check and took off totally ignoring my \"Thank you\".  Arrogant staff and the food wasn't great at all. The desserts were the worst of it all. $300 down the drain.  I highly recommend NOT going to this place."

It could have been a five star restaurant if it had a wider choice for the customers to choose. May consider coming back..."

We sat outside and they had plenty of heat warms to keep us toasty in February! Note: the max number of people they will seat is 4 ppl. Would highly recommend!"

        "Cheryll P.": "I had high expectations about Pearl, and unfortunately it was subpar (if that). We ordered several dishes to share including the grilled bavette steak, which was overcooked and very small. My husband ordered a half dozen oysters for himself and became violently ill that evening from the oysters. I emailed and reached out to Pearl the next day to let them know about my husband's food poisoning, and to this day (5 months later) we haven't heard from Pearl. We live within walking distance and I wouldn't go back nor would I recommend Pearl to anyone visiting."

Service 5/5 our server came around multiple times to make sure we were enjoying our meal and to make sure our glasses were always filled. She was really kind too!  Squid ink bucatini 5/5 Hands down the best thing we had. The Calabrian gives it the perfect kick and the tuna was perfect for the flavors of the noodles. Prawns 5/5 Second best dish since it has a lime flavor with a chili kick to it too. I think they may have used bird eye chilis.  Oysters 5/5 Pork chop 2/5 Very underwhelming compared to everything else and didn't really have a flavor but more of just straight up meat alone.  Steak 3/5 Wouldn't get again but the medium rare steak was good. They were precut into five thick slices and dint have too much flavor to it too. Cauliflower We had broccoli instead I think but it was the same toppings. Despite it being broccoli, it tasted good still"

I personally didn't like the sauce it came with but ate it with the salsa they brought for the chips and dip. The Mahi ceviche and the huevos rancheros was good too but didn't quite stand out. I would say you could pass and try something else!  For the lamb quesadilla, if you like lamb definitely go for it. But if you're not a fan of lamb and find it gamey, then this isn't for you.  Our waiter was sweet and attentive despite the busy brunch time which I appreciated.  To end our meal, we got the churros which is a MUST HAVE. Literally one of the best house made churros I ever had and I'm not being dramatic! The outside was crispy and sugary while the inside wasn't overly fried and slightly doughy/fluffy. It came with a sauce that wasn't too sweet either. You have to try it.  Next time I'll be back to try their AYCE/AYCD brunch menu!"

Every dish coming out to different tables is mouth watering.  Pan fried dumpling. The first and signature dish that arrived was the pan fried pork dumplings. Cooked to a good temperature, the wrap is seared to a good crunch. The meat inside was flavorful and bursted with juice. If there's anything that's a must try at this place, it has to be this dish.  The soup dumplings are also very good, don't break that easily and juicy. Nothing out of the ordinary but this is a staple that shows the quality of the workmanship of the craft, when it comes to dumpling. One unique thing worth trying is the savory soy milk (soup). It taste like a milky curdy broth. Not many places serve this.  The dry fried chicken wings are not that good. It's an easy pass and there are many places out there that do this dish better.  Overall, this place is good food and the service is good for a Chinese place. If you bring cash, the bill is a little cheaper, so prepare for that and support them in that way if you can."

I also got the Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Dumplings; unfortunately were not the best I've had because the skin was too thick compared to other places I've been..definitely not bad by any means though. Overall this place is priced fairly moderate; I got takeout and they took 15min or so."

Perfect choice for a typical foggy cold day in the city. With tea in hand to warm up the cold soul, we drank and studied the large menu. My early bird special companions ordered all things pork/chicken. I took the veggie route and was not disappointed. Hands down the best hot & sour soup we've had! Perfect balance of sour/savory/sweet/heat that just tantalizes between the cheek and parotid glands almost instantly drooling ensues. It's that amazing. Also the smoky-char-esk of the fire-wok fried rice and Shanghai Chow Mein was startlingly delectable. Eggplant dish was also flavorful and smoky! The pricy and proclaimed garlic pea sprouts were the perfect compliment to all the heavy laden sauces...it was crispy, simplistic fresh garlic goodness of quick fire veggies. The kid really loved their pork buns and fried rice. Would love to visit DK and try the other appetizing dishes we saw on other patrons tables. The hefty bill was worth the amount and quality of dishes we ordered. We had many togo boxes to eat left overs for the next couple days. Xxixi. We'll come back again soon."

Pretty safe choice - Dry braised string beans: Didn't seem the freshest and lacked flavor; not really garlicky which is what I'm used to - Pork XLB: Deflated wrapper, mushy meat. This was the most disappointing item of all. They really skimped on the meat filling Not terrible by any means but I wouldn't reorder from Dumpling Kitchen given the number of options out there"

        "Jenny N.": "The pan fried dumplings are the best I've ever had. This is a must try. You can smell the fried aroma when picking the dumpling up with your chopsticks. The crunchy texture along with the flavorful pork filling will make this dish the most memorable. The XLB is good. The dough isn't as chewy as I would like in my dumpling skin. Be careful with eating it with one go because the soup is piping hot.  The vegetarian shumai would satisfy any vegetarian cravings for dimsum. I like how abundant the vegetable is in each piece. Salted egg yolk bao is probably my favorite way to end the dinner. It's warm, savory and delicious. The bao is soft and the filling flows out after you bite into it. It's sooo goood.  The orders may take a while to come because they're freshly making the dumplings by hand. You can see them in the corner making it."

I was DD so decided to try Zero Proof drinks. The Rinse Rebeet $14 was lightly smoky, floral and herbaceous from the wilderton and amass riverine (botanical elixirs), with a touch of lime and coriander. Definitely never had this before and glad I tried it.  For starters we shared the shaved asparagus salad $19 with ricotta and crispy quinoa. Because we shared it, I don't think I got the full effect of the all the flavors and textures. It was very light.  The Baked Gigante Beans $16 was cooked in a tomato pesto stew. Warm and hearty.  Curried Cauliflower $12 with chickpeas was a side dish that came during appetizers. We ate it all up. Very tasty with the yogurt dip. Mediterranean in feel.  Entree Pork Chop $39 with red beans and crunchy hazelnuts. Great cut of bone in pork cooked medium rare - juicy and tender. The red beans and greens threw me off a little from the original pork chop I remembered from NOPA but this dish was still good. Savory and unexpected crunchy from the hazelnut additions.  Fried Chicken $29 came in with 4 pieces, hot and crispy with a chili honey. Even the white meat pieces were juicy. Definitely brined. Mmm.  Duck Breast $42 was cooked perfectly. Each piece was sliced just right. Not too fatty. Paired with cumin carrots and risotto. This dish was polished off quickly.  We didn't have space for dessert but I did order another zero proof drink. Coffee Date $14 made with Rose Tea, espresso, cardamom anise oat milk, honey and the twist of lime - sooo unbelievably good. Despite the tea and espresso it tasted so fresh and light. Loved it.

        "BitLeigh V.": "I decided to get a reservation for Nopa as I was visiting SF and the Yelp reviews had the highest remarks. I was easily able to get reservations on Opentable a week or so out with no issues. A friend in SF told me Nopa was just fine and not worth it, but I didn't listen. Mistake from me.  On a cold night, I'm so glad I chose an indoor reservation for my party of 2. We did show up 4 minutes early, but we were not seated until 15 minutes after our reservation time at 8:15pm tonight. For a place that consistently gets super booked up, you would think they have a good pattern down. It was even more disappointing to know when I walked to the back of the restaurant to the restroom and noticing 4+ empty tables that were cleaned off and the table set.  Once we were seated, the manager came by and apologized for the seating delay and told us there would be a gift from the chef. Great service (or so we thought). We decided to order the braised lamb shoulder and bread for our appetizers and a cider. The gift from the chef was the potato latkes. The lamb dish was so yummy and flavorful. I did wish there was more meat, but so delicious. The bread was good as well but the plating was odd as it tried to maintain a more modern approach. The potato latkes were so good and I enjoyed every bite. Potato latke itself might have been a smidge over fried but I love extra crispy potato.  After finishing our appetizers, we waited more than 30 minutes for our entrees. At this point, we were both ready to go elsewhere as the delay was so long. Also, the server I had took my cider glass I had away while I still had several sips left in my glass?? He never asked if he could take my glass or if I was finished? I was just rather too shocked to stop him in that moment. I don't know how this would be classified as good service especially as I paid for my full beverage and I expect to have it in its entirety.  For our entrees, we ordered the cheeseburger and the New York steak. My boyfriend got the avocado and bacon on his burger as well for an extra $6. He liked the burger and overall said it was good, but he noticed the patty itself was not cooked evenly.  The New York steak for me was the BIGGEST disappointment. As a big steak lover, this was a miss. I always eat steaks a medium rare and this steak was easily a rare in the very center and really blue. The steak and potatoes lacked salt. Potatoes seemed to be an afterthought with no flavor. The cilantro and herb blend they put on top had an incredibly weird and off putting flavor. It seemed they were trying to go in the chimichurri direction and missed. I've truly had better steaks and more enjoyable at Longhorn. I had maybe 4 bites before getting it to-go for anybody else to have.  We planned on getting dessert here, but I was really so over Nopa at this point. I asked for the check, signed, and left before seeing the amount charged onto my credit card which was over the amount I estimated mentally. I called Nopa and asked for my receipt to verify my receipt. Nopa charged my table with the \"gift from the chef\". Mistakes happen, but this \"gift\" actually was more of a inconvenience for me.  All in all, I won't be back here and can't recommend it given the other spectacular places in the area."

The ambiance is fun and airy and considering the crowd, not terribly noisy.  There were six of us so we got lots of different items from the menu. We ordered the bread and butter - exceptional, the dungeoness crab toast - generous and well seasoned, salad with avocado, oranges and nuts - fabulous! We also ordered the broccoli, and the cauliflower sides. Both were well prepared, tasty and generous. For the main courses we ordered the lamb meatballs, the pork chop, the pappardelli and the fried chicken. Everything was very good.  Here's why I can't give them a 5. The fried chicken was perfectly fried and deliciously crispy but by itself was very under seasoned. It did come with a chili honey sauce but it was just too sweet for me.  I found the menu here to be a bit limited. In other words if anyone in your party is a picky eater they may have trouble here. Be aware that the menu changes daily but they do seem to have some items consistently."

I've always enjoyed seeing the organized chaos of an environment but never knew a chefs table seat was something real. I know its not for everybody but if you care at all about a professional kitchen, get yourself a seat and enjoy! The relationship between all the cooks and the main chef, as well as watching everyones individual stations was such a sight for me. Honest to god would come back here just to watch these talented people make food. As for the cake, as predicted not loved by my partner, but I absolutely enjoyed it. The pomegranate with the delicate cake and vanilla ice cream all brought together for such a wonderful dining experience. One of the best desserts I've had in a while.  The interior is truly lovely and I wish I remembered our waitresses name but she was such a joy. We got to speak briefly to the chef and I completely embarrassed myself as I was still totally entranced with the entire place. I'd love to come again someday."

I am giving 3 stars for the food, because they were not consistently good It was overpriced and underwhelming. We had the crab salad, smoked trout, pappardelle, root vegetables, broccolini, mushroom toast, warm goat cheese crostini.  It's worth a try, but I definitely would not come back."

        "Tien Teena N.": "I've heard about this place for a while and finally got reservations to this place through Open Table and I will say the food is good but not absolutely \"amazing.\" Over all hit or miss for us and this is why:  I will say though that the cocktails were indeed AMAZING, pricier price point but amazing for sure. So u would recommend going here for nice drinks if you are looking to take someone out somewhere with an elevated ambiance and innovative drinks that is worth the bang for your buck - this is the place.  Food wise like I said it was good but wasn't better than some other places I've been with a lower price point. The pork chop was actually kind of salty, moist, perfectly cooked but salty for sure. I liked the house made pappardelle actually but I felt like I had better at other more authentic Italian places in the city. The desserts though - AMAZING, they used very creative flavors and the guava tartlet we had with the scoop of cream cheese ice cream was sooooooo good!  I still think this place is worth a try and would probably come back to try their other dishes."

We weren't able to get a reso before, but earlier today, I had checked OpenTable and saw an opening and snagged it! I called in around 5pm to make sure that my app transaction went through because OpenTable had a hiccup, and they picked up the phone, which I appreciated. The food was fantastic and the service as good as it was. The outdoor patio is well done--good lights, good heating, nice furnishings.  I also can't stop raving about the Kennebec fries--some of the best fries I've ever had. They stay crispy over our time outdoor dining, too! I'm usually not a fan of chunkier fries, but these take the cake. The avocado aioli that comes with the fries is also delicious.  We loved the malt milk chocolate ice cream too. It comes over olive oil and salt flakes. And it's very hard for us to do a night at NOPA without one of us having a cheeseburger and the other asking for half of it. The tagine (vegetarian) is hearty, filling, and tasty too."

We got there 2 hours early since we were already in the area, and they did not turn us away and took such good care of us! We even got seated an hour earlier than our reservation.  Hands down, the service is phenomenal here. They took care of our coats and did not rush us during our dinner (which tends to happen a lot close to the end of the night)  The meal was obviously great, the food here is so fresh and simple and executed so well."

The host was incredibly sweet and our server was as well. She was extremely knowledgeable and honest about the menu. I got the Bay Dreams cocktail and really enjoyed the potato latkes."

        "Eat M.": "Dumpling Home -- No Doubt, you definitely became my home away from home . I'm a big simp for some soup dumplings and wontons so when I saw Dumpling Home pass me by while out, I knew I couldn't just walk the other direction without indulging in some eatery. Let's get to the review shall we? -- I wanna say, the customer service and friendliness here at Dumpling Home that my friends and I received, was top TIER. It was really busy to where there was no inside seating, so we settled for sitting outside but they made sure we were comfortable. Down from the ordering process, to the food brought to the table, kindness and sureness. I loved how attentive our waiter was to our order, checking off everything we ordered on the receipt to make sure everything came to the table correctly and nothing was missing. Just an overall positive experience. I asked for his recommendation and he named his favorites, which were the wings, the crab pork dumplings, chili wontons, and the chicken dumplings. They also reassured us that they would cook things separately for us because of our friend is allergic to shellfish. I settled on the waiters favs, and also ordered a beef brisket noodle soup. I'll break it down real quick.. -- I wanna get into the good stuff first before I X out what I didn't like. The wings were literally fall on the floor good. Extremely crispy, falling off the bone as I ate them, and the sauce was delicious. It was sticky, sweet, and packed with a sensational umami garlicky flavor that had me licking the plate DOWN. I think those were my favorite dish besides the crab pork soup dumplings. I tasted more crab than pork, which is definitely not a complaint at all . The broth inside was buttery, rich, and almost creamy with a light crab taste. You could see the crab meat stuffed inside that it was almost coming out of the top, which made me happy since a lot of soup dumplings i've eaten were mostly skimpy filling and all noodle. The chili wontons were pretty good, a little bland but the sesame sauce they were tossed in helped provide more flavor. I was a bit disappointed because I expected a big punch of salty heat from the chili oil & sesame but didn't get that. Chicken dumplings weren't anything to jump up down about because they were average and pretty good enough. The beef brisket soup was a let down. Extremely bland, not even soy sauce or the vinegar could bring it some life. The tomatoes on top also watered the soup down even more and low-key were unnecessary but I didn't know they were gonna be in the soup, because I would've asked for them to remove it. The brisket was no where near tender, and covered in hard to chew rubbery fat. It was almost inedible and extremely disappointing since I paid quite a lot for the soup hence the brisket made it that price point. I couldn't finish it. -- This place is good, but low key hit or miss. I suggest you guys work on making that meat extra tender and trim off that inedible fat. Throw in some seasonings. I would come back here just for the things I like. Not bad for my first time visiting!"

By 5pm there were more people than tables, but service was so efficient, we placed our orders and got our food within 15 minutes.  I ALWAYS recommend the pan fried pork dumplings. It's a MUST. This time we tried the boiled beef tongue which was very tasty. And the numb and spicy pork xiao long bao had a rich and perfectly numbing spice. Their indoor AND outdoor seating is great. There's no difference in service speed when you sit outside like with other establishments. Couldn't recommend this place enough!"

Small place, one single-person restroom in the back, but you can watch the Xiao long bao being made while you wait.  We ordered the numb and spicy & the crab and pork Xiao long bao. Both were very juicy and tasty. The dumplings looked and tasted home made, the beef packets are shaobing with a thin beef filling & sauce that is reminiscent of the plum sauce that is usually eaten with Peking duck & gua bao. The green beans were great, very garlicky. Best item by far, though, was the juicy beef bao -- bursting with flavor, and had a great crispiness on the bottom. No need for dipping sauce, would definitely order again."

I'd stick to their specialties!!"

        "Annie S.": "Delicious food, quick service, and friendly staff. The restaurant does NOT take reservations so be prepared to wait or come during non-peak hours. Must get: - Pan-fried juicy pork baos. They weren't lying when they named them juicy baos because these were JUICYYYYYYY. Favorite dish of the night. - Pork XLBs. Classic dumpling dish that never disappoints. Skip: - Dan Dan mein (aka sesame paste noodles). It was underwhelming and did not have enough peanut butter flavor. The noodles were also on the mushy side.... I had such high hopes for the dish, so hopefully it was just an off night. - Pork wontons with sesame sauce and hot chili lol. This was also very underwhelming. I was expecting it to be spicy but it was more sesame-y and bland tasting. Not spicy at all."

        "Jessica K.": "This is my favorite dumpling spot in the city! Always fresh, piping hot with the same amazing quality and flavor each time. PSA: no reservations! My friends first introduced me to this place and I'm so glad they did because I've honestly come back a little too many times after, but I just can't get enough of all the delicious food! Dumpling Home is worth the hype and wait for sure. My favorite items are the dry-cooked green beans, juicy pork baos, and any one of the XLBs. You can't go wrong with those three items since you can get steamed and pan-fried dumps with some veggies on the side?! Yes. Be careful of those dumplings because they are LITERAL BALLS OF MOLTEN LAVA. I burned myself the first time I bit into a pan-fried bao because I didn't think there would be scalding soup inside. Good pain tho. I'd recommend you come during off-hours or right after the lunch rush or before dinner time, so you don't have to wait as long. The table turnover rate is pretty quick, and Hayes Valley is such a cute neighborhood that you can spend time walking around while you wait for a table to open up."

Really good and flavorful- some of the best you'll get in the city.  Brussel sprouts were mid- not much of a truffle flavor All the XLBs were very tasty Juicy pork bao- must get! Caution: they are very hot Chicken wings were very good as well"

        "Bonnie S.": "The dumplings here are SO GOOD! Our favorite xlb is the numbing spicy ones - very unique and the soup inside is delicious. Xlb's come in orders of 4 or 8. They have this special spoons to make sure you don't spill the soupy goodness! And pan fried pork buns are some of the best we've had in the sf Bay Area - crispy bottoms and fluffy bun. There is soup inside of those too! We've also gotten green beans and Dan Dan noodles - also really tasty. The green beans are cooked perfectly with delicious garlic sauce. The portions are good for 2 so order more if you're extra hungry or have more people! There is always a wait during dinner time but they use Yelp waitlist so you can clearly see where you are in line and walk around Hayes valley in the meantime. They have both indoor and outdoor seating (with heaters)."

Rick, our server, was very thoughtful and friendly. I wasn't familiar with Routier; we had never dined there. It was perfect for this evening. Upon arrival, we were greeted immediately, and we were guided to our table for two. The host and Rick were very thoughtful and friendly. We shared Dungeness Crab Pav, Pat, Fennel Salad, Bay Scallops, and Lamb. My favorites were Crab Pav and the Lamb; my wife enjoyed the Pat and the Fennel Salad. The wine pairing was excellent as well; we took recommendations from Rick. My wife had a glass of Roero Arneis, and I had a Bordeaux. Unfortunately, I didn't get the name. It was an excellent meal, and I would say that the cost-to-experience ratio was very fair."

        "Nathan S.": "Went for an early Valentine's Day dinner. Got the chicken liver pate, eggplant, pumpkin soup, squash risotto, and potato pave. Also got a carafe of rose, which was very reasonably priced and a nice addition to the meal.  The chicken liver mousse was my favorite thing we got. It was super clean without andy offal flavor, and was served with a sweet jammy substance (maybe black currant?) and bread crisps. The portion was also quite large, as there were two large quenelles of mousse, so I would not recommend eating a full portion by yourself (though for better or for worse I did -- my dining companion is vegetarian). The eggplant was good but maybe my least favorite dish of the evening as it was a little one note with the creaminess of the cheese and sweetness of the sauce. The hen of the woods mushrooms with au poivre sauce (not pictured) were great. The mushrooms were cooked well and served as a great vehicle for the unbelievable sauce. The pumpkin soup was delicious. Super creamy and rich (a theme throughout this meal) and the pistachio praline was a brilliant addition. I don't know how they made a non-sweet praline, but it provided a nuttiness and nice textural component to the diah. Wouldn't say i got any lime though. The risotto was excellent, though I think i may have actually preferred the dish without the sweetness of the squash (though I can't say there's too many dishes with squash that I love). I was a bit disappointed with the potato pave. The layers weren't distinct in each block and there was a \"home-frying\" element to pave I couldn't quite place (perhaps the herbs in the potatoes?) but was slightly off putting. There's a similar potato preparation for the patatas bravas at Red Window at North Beach that I think was much more well done. Overall a fantastic meal. I think 6 dishes for two people (2 snacks, 3 small plates, one main) was slightly too much. Would recommend the chicken liver pate, mushrooms au poivre, squash risotto, and pumpkin soup. Wouldn't recommend the eggplant or the potato pave, though neither was bad. You may fall into a brief butter coma after a meal here :)."

Of course since we were there at 5:30p service was all ours for a while, but even after it got full (within 30-45 min) service was still great. We had the crab pave, pumpkin soup, cod, sole, and mousse. Everything was delicious! Good blend of flavors, the chef even made the crisped potato for the pave specially to avoid soy oil for me. It was perfect. Every bite was yum, fresh ingredients, decent size portions, spotless clean bathroom, we had a great meal and experience. No photos as we just enjoyed eating the food!"

Crab pave and hen of the wood mushrooms and roast pineapple napoleon were the standout dishes. Everything else was good. Calamari was the only so-so.

The dungeness crab pave was the standout, but the other dishes, while solid, were rather forgettable. Liked the flavors of the hen of the woods mushroom. Though they were decent, I was bored by fish and short ribs. We weren't fans of the dessert menu, as it was very mousse heavy, and we were hoping for more pastry-related desserts (love b. patisserie!). We did ask for an order of fresh madeleines."

I enjoyed the ambiance, service, and the meal but likely wouldn't go back if I had to pay as there are so many other places I need to try still. There wasn't anything special that would make me crave it."

        "Amy -.": "TL;DR - Disappointing In the quest to finish Infatuation's Top 25 in SF, Routier presented itself as my next target. Unfortunately neither myself or my hubby enjoyed our meal or experience. Easy to make a reservation, we were seated promptly. I put in two quick appetizers: - duck rillettes - brocoli raab I absolutely despised the duck rillettes - it was so flavorless and didn't spread well at all even though we did let it sit for a bit. It was boring. I'm grateful they gave us extra bread. The raab was my favorite dish of the night. We then placed a drink order, and while we were about to put in the rest of the order the guy who served us basically wouldn't let us. It was odd, and we didn't like that because we had a gap in the meal. For the rest of the meal, we ordered: - crispy squid - fennel salad - duck leg confit - crispy alaskan halibut I loved the cirpsy squid. It was different than fried calamari at other places; the sauce was good. I hated the duck leg confit. I loved the halibut but we did agreed it was small portion, and it was pricy because of the oddly topped truffle shavings.  Overall, I'd skip this place. The good news is that there were lots of parking in the streets, not too hard to find."

Would recommend the dungeness crab pav, and both of the entres (farro and mushroom \"risotto\" and shortrib confit) ended up being really good. All the desserts sounded amazing, and the two that we ordered were both delicious."

Phenomenal! A must order! The Mouse went well with the Red Currant and the Crisp which was brushed with a sweet butter. Then Hen of the Woods \"Au Poivre\"...another winner deserving of a Michelin star on its own. For main entres we had the Shortrib confit (oooh so tender) with a Celery- Chestnut pure and young cabbage and mustard au jus. Delicious and extremely satisfying. I had The Dungeness Crab Pav with a spicy mayo and Tempura Asparagus (in Season). Delectable and Delightful. The ambiance was warm and welcoming with a touch of elegance!

Love the interior design and ambiance, great for date night or nice dinner with family.  Food: 1) Dungeness Crab Pav [8/10] : loved this one (kind of tasted like filet o fish on a hash brown) super hot, crispy, and fresh. A great start to dinner and would recommend.  2) Carrots and Green Strawberries [8/10] : personally love heirloom carrots - the strawberries add a nice sourness to the sweet carrots and brown butter. Had it with the duck confit and thought they paired nicely 3) Monterey Squid [6/10] : pretty good, was essentially elevated calamari. The chili sauce was quite yummy  4) Hen of the Woods Mushroom [6/10]: umami and flavorful - the greens on top really added a nice freshness to the creaminess of the mushrooms. Personally enjoyed the carrots more, thought this dish was a bit salty.  5) Duck Confit [8/10] : superb duck - tender and meat melts in your mouth. The fig pairing also added a nice sweetness to the duck (was divine!!) Highly recommend as one of the main dishes 6) Alaskan Halibut [5/10] : thought it was a bit overcooked, it was average fish, nothing special, but half of it probably is due to halibut's texture.  7) Peach and Blackberry Napoleon [10/10] : tasty dessert, not super sweet, light and delicate. The pastry is super flakey and the cream does not feel fatty. Highly recommend!!b Overall, above average restaurant. Good service, nice ambiance, good food (not blow me away fantastic but tasty and well executed)"

        "Tashi C.": "The laundromat is the newest addition of food options to my neighborhood in the Outer Richmond, which is saying a lot because there are so many good options! Previously a real laundromat, the new owners decided to keep the name and cleverly make it a wine and beer bar with pizza in the afternoons in the evenings and sell bagels and cream cheese for breakfast during the day Just ingenious. I came for the first time a month ago and got there by 8am, and there was already a line out of the door. It's not an issue because it moved quickly. However, if you want the freshest bagels, go early for sure. The prices are reasonable for bagels, I believe ($4-$5), and the cream cheese is homemade for $6 for a small container. Don't quote, but it was not overpriced.  I got the pumpernickel and cinnamon raisin bagel with plain cream cheese. I live for these bagels flavors!  The bar inside was well designed and looked very cute, and like somewhere, I would take someone on a date and then come back the next for breakfast.  Very cute spot"

The interior is beautifully decorated, full of plants and records while the bar stacked with collection of wines. Would recommend a wine shot if you're curious about what to get. At $5 a shot you can taste test a sample at a relatively low cost.  The pizzas here come with that crispy edge and glorious crunch. Square pan pizza is definitely a heavier meal but the fresh toppings and honey drizzle make for a lighter flavor. Our table of 4 ordered 2 pizzas and a salad to share.  The kale salad was refreshing and a good break from all the carbs. However we would have loved to see the kale a bit more massaged and dressed. The mushroom combo pizza was the star of the night. Not often we opt for a white sauce pizza but the sauce complimented the mushrooms making for a rich flavor. We did note that the mushroom pizza did come with a heavy sprinkling of parsley so if you're not a fan magnet ask for it on the side.  Definitely opt for the honey as it adds a sweet kick to each bite! The meatball pizza came with a good amount of toppings and the fresh burrata made for a creamy bite. Each pizza comes with 6 pieces and piping hot out of the oven. Perfect for sharing and sampling different flavors.  Will be back for more crispy edges and wine!"

Not too many bagels left this late in the morning but we still got pumpernickel everything, salt bagel, plain everything and a couple drip coffees. We already had cream cheese at home so we didn't buy any of their made-in-house flavored cream cheese. First up, the bagels! The bagels are great - nice crust with perfectly chewy interior. I think the pumpernickel everything is my favorite here. Great balance of rye flavor and some sweetness. We had it with cream cheese - both plain and toasted. Both were great. Salt bagel was my second flavor because that's something I haven't had in a long time. Second, the coffee. It's self service, and there are packets of sugar and other sweeteners, small jugs of oatmeal, cake and half and half. It was perfect! I really appreciate that. They have reusable spoons to store your coffee. They have a glass for putting into used spoons. There's no place to eat here for Bagels. You bring it home. That worked perfectly for us. We were so intrigued by this place, that we came back later that day. We ordered the kale salad, brussels sprouts, and Detroit style cheese pizza. We also had some drinks. Everything was so great! Such an asset to the neighborhood. I'll definitely be back! A shout out to Jamie who helped us with the bagels in the morning. She was very helpful!"

Everything was bomb so I figure you can't go wrong with ordering any of the pizzas.  The server talked us through their menu and was super helpful.  This place does not take reservations, so if you plan on coming, make sure your whole party is here and you'll get seated. I can see how this place would get packed on any given night.

        "Tabitha C.": "I've had the pleasure of eating here a handful of times now and I must say, this is easily one of the best bagel shops in the Bay Area. The bagels themselves are wonderful. I've tried the everything and sesame bagels with various cream cheeses - all combos have been absolutely delicious. The bagel texture was perfectly chewy and had just the right amount of saltiness, while the well-balanced schmears were flavorful and creamy. They have a somewhat traditional and slightly limited bagel flavor assortment, but a few really interesting cream cheese options. My personal favorite thus far has been the Calabrian chili cream cheese. The only downside is that they do not cut and toast bagels for you. They also only offer schmears in to-go tubs. Preparing the bagel for immediate consumption should be standard practice for a bagel shop, so hopefully they will start to do this as they gain their footing. In the meantime, if you see me struggling to saw my bagel in half with an old Chipotle plastic knife in the parking lot, mind ya business.  Despite the shaky, undeniably California-esque bagel experience overall, I would still highly recommend this place. The prices are decently reasonable for this area, the staff are lovely, and the bagel taste and texture is unbeatable."

Don't forget the house made delicious cream cheese spreads. Try them all. Friendly service with a smile is always refreshing in the morning for bagel pickups. Thank you!"

        "Emily Z.": "Quick and easy pickup spot for some bagels!! Came in around 9AM on a Saturday morning and there wasn't much of a line. They close the inside of the restaurant, so you just pop in to order your bagels and go. We opted to try the egg, everything, and cinnamon raisin. Unfortunately, they were already sold out of the egg everything by the time we got there. We also got a tub of the salmon and dill cream cheese.  I really enjoyed both the egg and the everything bagel. The egg bagel was so fluffy and chewy, the texture was so yeasty and incredible. The everything bagel was also really flavorful. The cream cheese was whipped and light, but I wish the flavor was a little more intense.  Definitely recommend coming for some amazing bagels! Will be coming back to try the other cream cheese spreads, as well as their dinner service for pizza!"

        "Wendy H.": "Picked up bagels from The Laundromat. They aren't actually a laundromat. This is a bagel and pizza place. They are housed in a former laundromat thus the name. Bagels are good. Soft inside and crunchy outside. If you've had Montreal style bagels, this is pretty close to that without having to buy a ticket to Montreal. They make their own cream cheese too. I liked the scallion one. Bagels early morning until 2:00 PM. Sometimes they close early because they literally sell out before closing time. Pizza only available at night. Service was friendly. Minus one star because these bagels are pricey but if you want a once in awhile treat, definitely buy your bagels from here"

        "Karen Y.": "Been waiting to try this restaurant since reading its write up on SF Eater and browsing their menu.  First off--their service is impeccable. I initially had a larger table reservation and I had a couple of cancellations on the day of my reservation. I called ahead and they were more than accommodating and understood my situation. Once seated at the restaurant, the service is a little slower compared to other restaurants but while I did notice the slow down of service, I was personally fine with it as I was there to catch up with a friend and I didn't really have anywhere else to go after dinner. They are extremely busy--I do recommend getting a reservation as I saw a group try to get a walk in table and there just wasn't enough tables so they left.  The ambiance--what can I say about the ambiance that pictures don't already say in a thousand words or more? The exterior of the building can be deceiving as it looks like a generic white box however once you're inside, you're transported to this lush, green space with hanging plants, rattan lights, and cozy, earthy space.  Food order for the night: 1. Slow-Cooked Octopus: super tender, the butter knife cut straight through the octopus and the spices were the perfect level of heat and spice. The fruit surrounding the octopus brightened up the dish with its color and sweetness.  2. Dindigul Style Chicken Biryani: it looks deceptively like a small amount but split it with a friend and it was definitely enough for both of us. There's something spicy in the rice itself but with the raita and salan it definitely helped cool down some of those spices (so if you find yourself overwhelmed with the spice level of the rice, just add those sauces to your rice!)  3. \"God's Own\" Coconut Variation: I would come here just for this dessert. The MVP of the night--the textures & layers of flavors were so satisfying. Each bite was an adventure. And the coolness of the dish was so helpful after eating a spice-filled meal.  4. Semi-Frozen Bay Leaf Slice: this dessert was really well balanced when it came to sweetness. Looking at it I was expecting a sort of tiramisu sort of sweetness and it wasn't. The texture was like a semifreddo and there were some (macerated?) kumquat on the bottom that sometimes tasted like strawberries and other times tasted like cherry tomatoes.  5. Tiger's Eye (Non-Alcoholic Cocktail): love that this cocktail wasn't very sweet; very spice forward and has a mellow taste Overall--most importantly--do I recommend this place? YES!!! If you're looking for a meal that will engage all your taste buds definitely give Copra a try!"

        "Maya Z.": "We got scammed through tip here. Luckily we took a photo of the receipt with how much we tipped so we were able to dispute the charge with our credit card company. Came here for dinner last week with our friends and the food was honestly great. We ordered the fried chicken, masala dosa, crab curry, rasam poori, shrimp vennai, lamb shoulder, and the chutney palette. Everything was pretty great, but we could've done without the rasam poori.  Service was extremely slow and the time between our apps and entrees took forever. The worst part was after they cleaned up our plates after the entrees and the waiting time for the dessert menu. We waited nearly 20 minutes to get a dessert menu and by then we wanted to hit up a new spot. A bit bummed because we wanted to try the \"God's own\" dessert.  Food really makes up the stars for this review. Service was mid, but stealing through tip -- really?"

        "Michelle H.": "Date of Visit: 4/7/2023 Opened by the chef behind Ettan in Palo Alto, Copra located in Japantown in San Francisco is one of the most anticipated restaurant opened in 2023. As a Michelin star chef, Srijith Gopinathan worked in Campton Place for more than 15 years, decided to bring Kerala and Sri Lanka street food into Bay Area. I love the decoration in Copra near Japantown, just like an urban oasis in the heart of the city. Drinks: From the Ground Up $17 Clarified Lassi Punch $18 Orange Ruby $15 We ordered 2 cocktails and 1 non-alcoholic beverage. All were just alright.  Little: Shrimp Vennai Roast $18 I love the shrimp roasted in Chili Chutney. Good flavored and a little spicy. Slow-Cooked Octopus $19 The octopus was good too! Also slightly spicy. Thattukada Fried Chicken $16 This is a street food classic from the streets of Trivandrum.  Large: Konkan Crab Curry $36 We got the crab curry roasted with coconut, coriander, tamarind and red onion. With an Egg appam on the side to put the crab meat in.  Black Cod Pollichathu $42 The black cod was wrapped in banana leaves and cooked in cast iron.  \"Gods Own\" Coconut Variation $15 Very special dessert called Gods Own with coconut water crystals, mango, candied basmati puffs and sabja seeds.  Semi-frozen Bay Leaf Slice $12 I love this dessert with kumquat and sugarcane syrup. The bay leaf slice tasted like frozen ice cream mixed with custard."

        "Lety C.": "Good experience overall. SF needed an Indian Fine Dining spot and this place built into the prior restaurant (Dosa) decor and elevated its ambiance. The food was good - make sure you are prepared for a very spicy punch with the curries and chutneys. They all have a strong kick to it and not for very sensitive palates. If you are used to Indian level of spices it's ok. Among a multitude of dishes I tried I have to say my favourites, surprisingly were the desserts. Don't miss them out - I loved ALL of them and i don't have a sweet tooth usually. Service was fast enough."

We recently came from Tulum and design of the restaurant is very much like that tropical oasis: white decor and lots of wood. Coastal South Indian + Sri Lankan food from Michelin 2 star Chef! Lots of vegan options, the food on the served plates was gone and devoured so fast and I missed an opportunity to capture it. Dosa was brought last so I have a picture of that crispy heaven. The green salad with Indian dressing is a must try, even my husband who is not big on salads enjoyed it!"

Food was absolutely delicious- from the pani puri, to the dosa, to the pau bhaji. I really liked the lamb curry also, which was very heavily spice. This place is NOT designed for angloid palates- he specifically has said in many interviews that the food is supposed to be challenging and he isn't going to change. The dosa was thin and perfectly crispy too. One very small bit- I wish that the staff would pack items for you, as my wife and I couldn't really finish everything. Service was perfect and I hope to come back again, and you should definitely make a trip here!"

        "Yunjing H.": "Now one of my favorite restaurants in SF! Set notification on for Resy and was able to get a reservation for 3 on Saturday night the week of. They also allow walk in's at the bar or lounge and you'll have a higher chance of getting seated if you come around 5-5:30.  The ambiance is so cute love the plants and the ropes I feel like I'm in a vacation home in Bali. Waitress Gabriella was attentive and knowledge about the menu. I let her know it's my sisters bday and she got us complimentary sorbet with candle.  Now onto food, in order from my favorite to least favorite:  Octopus - my favorite dish! It's so tender in the inside but crispy on the outside. The presentation is beautiful with the little flowers grapefruits and oranges.  Watalapan - for dessert we ordered this grilled pineapple with flan custard and cream and I loved it! It's so pretty and delicious but I'm also biased because I love flan. The waitress said this is a traditional Sri Lanka dessert.  Shinko pear & sundal salad - salad is so refreshing and everything go so well together.  Masala dosa - the dosa is so crispy and the masala potatoes was great. They came with four different sauces / curries of which three were spicy. I thought this dish was good but comparable to dosas I could've gotten at other South Indian places.  Lamb shoulder - the meat is tender but the curry is very spicy. I would say I have a decent spice tolerance but had to drink a lot of water for this. We ordered extra rice for $5 for the curry will recommend doing that. I also took the leftover curry to go to eat with my bread."

I was already a little bit disappointed because the service wasn't so great so far! Once we seated, a waiter came to us, we asked for suggestions helping us a little bit. We ordered a bottle of wine and few things to share that I don't really remember the name. Food was good, but they cover many dishes with a lot of spices. And also the portions, especially the larges one, are very little. But the thing that bothered me a lot was the high level of the music...it was difficult to hear my friends. Overall, I don't know if I really enjoy the whole experience. I tried the restaurant in Palo Alto and the experience was much better in terms of food, environment and service."

You'll feel like you stepped into a classy NYC restaurant in the middle of SF with the tasteful decor and elegant plateware.  Special call out to the waiters who knew the ins and outs of the menu. With some tough words to pronounce and uncommon ingredients, it was certainly impressive and much appreciated.  Food wise: get the fried chicken (I didn't have high expectations but this might have been the best), the bone marrow (the combo of the gravy and flaky paratha is mind blowing), and frozen bay leaf slice for dessert (almost like delightful cross between a cheesecake and kulfi). The chicken curry id probably skip but only because the other things were so much better. The shrimp appetizer was also better than I expected. Oh and I didn't give a care in the world and went to town on the crab with my hands - my neighbors probably thought I was nuts. It was incredible.  Will be back to try the fish, vada pav, lamb and octopus."

        "Jenny O.": "I was luckily able to go to one of the extended special 10 course dinners with sake pairings last Friday. What a fantastic meal! I loved every single dish and that isn't even an exaggeration. I continue to be amazed by how Clint and Yoko continue to hone their craft and create such impeccable dishes. The last time I visited, Clint mentioned they were thinking about changing up their first course after having it be the deviled egg for so many years. I was really excited to see what it was replaced with and the financier did not disappoint. What a perfect bite! The firefly squid with a little chili kick was such a good balance. I could not get enough of that uni/shrimp/monkfish liver/seaweed/rice cracker course, one of my faves. The homemade smoked chashu might be the best chashu I have ever had. The bf was so excited to see white asparagus (which reminded him of when he lived in Germany where it's more common), and he ate all of his scallops as well which is a sign of how good that particular dish was because I often get some of his scallop since he has a very mild allergy to them but when I peeked at his dish, they were already all gone haha. The wagyu katsu sando paired with the pickles was another one of my favorite dishes. Deciding to katsu the bread instead of the meat was really creative and worked super well. The crab ramen was great; really glad to be able to have it before crab season ends. The shaved ice and almond tofu was so refreshing after dinner and not too sweet (the best dessert compliment haha). The basque cheesecake with a light coffee flavor was also divine. Perfect meal from start to finish! Oh and all of the sakes were great as well. Nice variety and just the right quantity."

        "Ben L.": "Noodle in the Haystack is an authentic experience of a passionate chef who has traveled abroad to Japan and is looking to bring his experience and food back home to the Bay. If you're lucky enough to get a reservation, this experience is definitely worth the money that you pay for it.  1. The food was outstanding. You can tell that there was a lot of thought put into each dish, including the story of the ingredients and how they play into each other. The chef has been experimenting with creating his own noodles, and its a shame that we aren't given more to feast on, as you can taste the hard work that has gone into them. Noodle in a Haystack also incorporates ingredients based on their seasonality, ensuring that only the best quality and freshness are presented. The \"Pig in a Blanket\" (Potato wrapped with Wagyu) was definitely spectacular, as the richness of the Wagyu played well with the creaminess and starch of the potato.  2. There are a few unique aspects about this place, including their expensive water filter which produces high quality water that is a treat to drink.  3. The chef is an enthusiastic Bay Area native who wants to bring the Japanese eating experience back home, and you can tell that he is authentic about his passion. He is extremely engaging and will go into detail about each and every dish and the reasons that went into producing it. By some standards, he would be considered an amateur chef, but doubters beware, with more time and experience, he will soon prove to be a chef that sets the standard for the Japanese Fine Dining experience in the Bay Area.  4. The ambience was very nice, as there was a lot of lighting to showcase the kitchen as well the process of making each dish to be served.  5. The only complaints that we would have are that we were still hungry after the meal; perhaps an add-on to the meal is something that can be incorporated into a future menu. The portions are not what I would call generous, though there is a strong argument to be made that the higher the quality the ingredient, the pricier it is, therefore cutting into the amount that can be provided.  All-In-All, you would be lucky to get a reservation here. It is worth the price and the hype, and if you want to be able to sample some innovative Japanese cuisine, this is the right place to be!!!"

        "Johnny W.": "Summary: So much more than just fancy ramen Details: For the uninitiated, Noodle in a Haystack has been around for many years now, originally operating as a ramen-focused popup at various venues, with reservations that were largely impossible for most to get. Since those early days, the business has evolved significantly, with Clint and Yoko opening up their own brick and mortar space (after many a bureaucratic roadblock), reservations being marginally easier to get (you have a ~15 minute window now instead of ~30 seconds), and the menu having turned into something more akin to kaiseki (though still built around a star noodle dish, of course). I was lucky to nab a last minute opening during their soft launch month, and got to see and taste the fruits of their labor, as my girlfriend and I were treated to a bevy of courses: some, significantly more stellar than others, but all enjoyable in some form, and each presented with a bit of fanfare and background from the couple themselves. While the main noodle (a wagyu aburasoba the day we went) itself was obviously one of the star dishes, their caviar financier, kakuni karaage, and annin kakigori were also particularly outstanding. Absolutely worth a shot if you can snag a reservation. And while $225 after included tax and tip is certainly a steep price for ramen, it's more palatable if you think of it in terms of a tasting menu at a Michelin star restaurant, with the same expectation of care and quality put into the dishes. Accessibility: The space is a bit smaller and comprised of bar counter seating only, but they specifically designed a wheelchair accessible portion with a lower counter towards the far end!"

        "Eric Joseph D.": "I have been in love with Noodle in a Haystack and Clint & Yoko since 2016 and I am so happy I finally got to eat at their new restaurant. To be honest, I was unsure when the restaurant would open, but it was definitely worth the wait! The open faced chef's table-esque kitchen and modern/sleek design is extremely welcoming and the lighting is great for photos. I didn't tell Clint & Yoko this, but this was one of my first meals after recovering from food poisoning so I was unsure if I was going to even enjoy it, but oh boy, was this one of my favorite meals of the year. I can talk about all of the dishes in detail, but here are some of my favorites:  +Japanese Avocado Toast - Mashed avocado with smoked trout on top of a deep fried donut hole. Finished with finger limes and a cold pressed African Green Chilli oil. This was magical... +Spanish blue fin toro tar tar tart - Toro on top of a tart? Got to love that ingenuity! Inspired by a sushi roll, they top it off with a regular pickle, smoked pickle, and shishito leaf. +Wagyu Abura Ramen - First of all, can we talk about the noodles they are using? Wagyu, wagyu butter, and those beautiful noodles. Come on! I mean come on! I am drooling just thinking about this. This was the star. I could have eaten a couple bowls of this.  Also, Clint & Yoko are some of the nicest people I have ever met and it brings me so much joy to eat their food in such a beautiful space. For $150 a person, you get at least 7-8 courses and an intimate dining experience. They are rotating their menu and experimenting with local and seasonal ingredients so my experience will probably be different from the next person, but it is definitely worth trying out if you can snag a reservation!"

        "Jenny H.": "I had a phenomenal dining experience at Noodle in a Haystack! One glance at the name and you'd immediately think that it's just a ramen shop, but there are SO many layers here. It's an omakase and ramen shop with Asian fusion vibes and a monthly ramen style. They're constantly experimenting with new recipes, so the menu is always changing. The 8 courses ($125/person) were rich with flavor, umami, and creativity. While the star of the show was definitely the beautifully crafted and delicious ramen, the other food elements still lingered in my mind. My taste buds were dancing because I was transported back to my time in Japan. BONUS: Clint and Yoko are super sweet, kind, thoughtful, and knowledgeable! They initially ran their pop-up around the Bay Area, but the Kickstarter project helped bring their dream of opening a shop in SF to life. The current seating arrangement allows each guest to easily communicate with them. Clint explained each dish (and fun facts) with immaculate detail. They also have a special Pi-water filter! Note that this restaurant has no defined menu, so the items below might not be the same when you visit. However, there will probably be variations of these items. Either way, you won't be disappointed :)  1. Avocado toast with chili olive oil: Bite-sized bread with avocado. It looks really simple, but the acidity and flavor were very balanced. 2. Rice crackers with uni and mix of fresh fish: The rice crackers brings me back to my childhood. The uni and fish were incredibly fresh and creamy. I need more of this in my life.  3. Kanpachi with ponzu sauce: Great ponzu sauce with a nice crunch from the onions! 4. Chilled tofu: The sauce was inspired by tantanmen and mala, so you'll get a nice kick of umami. It was so smooth. 5. 16-hour braised pork belly: WOW, the best pork belly that I've ever had. It literally MELTED in my mouth. Smooth like butter *cues BTS song* :) This gave me KBBQ vibes because of the meat + salad combo. 6. Radish and pickled vegetables (shared between 2 people): So refreshing and tasty! I'd love to have this on the side at all times. 7. Abura soba ramen: THE best ramen I've ever had and on the same wavelength as the best ramen places in Japan. This gave me Mi Goreng vibes, but amplified x1000. The onions were sweet and mild without the spicy onion flavor. Their wagyu butter and wagyu fat mousse in the sauce were divine. Soak the noodles with the orange egg yolk for some extra creamy flavor. It was SO FREAKING DELICIOUS. 8. Almond jello with kiwi and shaved ice: Great way to end the night with super light dessert!"

        "Renee Y.": "We started trying to get reservations for this place in 2019 and finally got them in 2020, but unfortunately with the pandemic it got pushed several times. After 2 whole years we were finally able to reschedule for their kickstarter and it was well worth the long wait.  This restaurant is super intimate with just 8-12 seating and there's only 3 staff members including Yoko and Clint. Throughout our dinner, we were able to hear about their journey in opening their new space and unfortunately, they're actually not allowed to have a full kitchen setup due to permit issues. We saw them using portable burners to cook the ramen and a toaster oven to heat up their proteins. However, with that said, it's still amazing what they can create even with limited resources available.  We got our reservations with the Wagyu Abura Soba and our meal consisted of 7 courses. It included appetizers, small dishes/palette cleansers, ramen, and dessert. Each course was delicious in their own ways and it was actually more food than I anticipated. I was stuffed by the end of the meal and I ended up giving some of my ramen to my bf to finish because I wanted to save room for dessert.  It's definitely hard to get reservations here, but definitely keep trying because it's so worth it. For the quality of their craft and ingredients, I agree with another yelper and can foresee them getting a Michelin Star somewhere in the future. Hoping they will reopen their reservations again soon so we can come back!"

        "Eric L.": "I originally had reservations for this pre-pandemic pop-up celebrating home-made Japanese noodles for March 13, 2020. In the two-and-a-half years since my aborted reservation, the restaurant found a brick-and-mortar location and appears to have developed a singular vision of how to elevate a college-food staple to fine dining extravagance. Every ingredient is steamed, frozen, pured, broiled, grilled, whatever, all in an effort to stun the palate. Even sesame seeds and lettuce are intentional choices to highlight the husband-and-wife chefs' creativity. It's still a soft opening, and the regular kinks of post-pandemic dining out persist, but this is a restaurant doing something no one else is doing and doing it impressively."

      {
        "Eric T.": "Eating at Noodle is like watching 2 talented and dedicated artists perform at the highest level. The husband and wife team pay close attention to the tiniest details to deliver a one-of-kind dinner. For example, the ramen dish required many hours of labor over several days to make. After tasing the broth, meat, and noodle in the ramen (separately first, and then together), there is no doubt in my mind that they have achieved perfection. (It is no surprise that they won first place in the Ramen contest in Tokyo.) Another example is the filtered water that they use to make the broth for the ramen and to serve in water glasses. The water are filtered to achieve the same PH level as in a human body so that the broth in the ramen contained only the taste of the ingredients that the chef intended and absolutely nothing else. Besides the ramen (and/or udon), the fixed menu dinner also included many other courses and deserts that were a joy to watch them prepare and to eat. If you are fortunate (or persistent) enough to grab a reservation, make sure you also get the sake pairing which included many unusual and hard-to-get bottles that paired perfectly with the food."

But they have just opened the shop just a few months ago and before that they were just doing pop-up. So I tried to find a way to get a reservation and you could make it on Tock. I was on the waitlist and luckily, I got a seats. So let's talk about the restaurant and food now. The restaurant has no sign and it's really new. Clean looks and only table seating. I got there early and got to seated first. Nice counter bar. We got the beverage menu and order the sake pairing. First : the devils egg with crispy chicken skins and salmon roe Second : tofu with tomato like caprese salad Third : sashimi Hawaiian amberjack Fourth : tofu crab with Uni Fifth : deep fried pork belly salad Sixth : housemade ramen noodle Seventh : shaved ice  Overall: food was good but only little things that could be improved such as the temperature and the fat of the beef was chewy. Service was very friendly but with the price of 125$ that you could also go enjoy at some Michelin star. Still need to step up a little bit.  Looking forward to come back again though when they change the menu."

        "Winnie L.": "Overall, Beretta is a nice Italian restaurant with a slightly modern twist, offering a solid dining experience with delicious food and attentive service! The ambiance is a mix between being romantic but also vibrant with the music playing in the background.  My friend and I shared the bartender's pizza and linguini frutti de mar (seafood pasta) - both were really delicious and would highly recommend these! My other friends shared the restaurant week special, which included lasagna, arancini, and tiramisu. They also really enjoyed their dishes and found them to be well-prepared and delicious. One of my other friends who has been here before said Beretta has the best lasagna of SF! 1) Bartender's pizza: the highlight of my meal. It was topped with spicy marinara, pepperoncini, olives, burrata, and sausage, and it was one of the best pizzas I've had in San Francisco. The restaurant was generous with the toppings, the crust was perfectly crispy, and the burrata was a nice creamy addition that elevated the flavors! 2) Linguini frutti de mar: also yummy and fresh! It had a decent amount of seafood and was perfectly flavorful with a nice spicy kick. The pasta itself was cooked to perfection, and the combination of flavors worked well together. The only thing I'd caveat is that there was a bit of sand in the mussels/ clams when I was eating it.  The only downside of Beretta is that it could be a bit cheaper, but the prices seem to be in line with SF Italian food prices. Despite this, I would still highly recommend Beretta and would love to come back again to try more items on their menu like the cauliflower and brussel sprout appetizers."

Since we went during happy hour, the pizza margarita was much cheaper, but also slightly smaller (still enough for the 2 of us). Nothing notable to say; it was a pretty solid pizza. The lasagna's cheese tasted a bit off to me, hence why I docked .5 points, but it tasted normal to my partner.  Service (5/5): We had a reservation, but the restaurant was only half full when we went during happy hour. We were seated promptly, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  Ambiance (5/5): The restaurant is very well decorated and felt very spacious! Overall (4.5/5): I highly recommend coming during happy hour to get their Brussels sprouts and cheaper pizza! I hope they make their Brussels sprouts a permanent part of the menu at some point and not just limited to happy hour."

        "Ada H.": "How disappointing that one of my favorite restaurants in the city has become my least favorite. Not only has the quality and quantity gone down, the service is almost nonexistent. My friend and I had reservations and we were promptly seated but from there we waited 25 minutes before we finally flagged down the waitress so that we could order. After ordering, the food slowly trickled in. Walnut buratta toast- (2/5) what use to be a crunchy buttery toast ended up being a stale soggy slice of bread with barely any buratta.  Arugula and fennel salad- (0/5)opted for this because they no longer carry their delicious kale salad. This salad was bitter (which is how arugula is suppose to taste) but had nothing to really elevate the flavors of the arugula.  Lasagna- (0/5) the pasta was doughy and undercooked. Sad. Even after asking for the bill, it still took 15 minutes before we finally got the check. I was embarrassed at how much I hyped up this spot to my friend just to be left with the feeling of regret. Hopefully Beretta can get back to the same prestigious level that they use to be in."

We ordered: 1. 2 burrata pizzas with olives and spicy marinara. 1 had sausage on it. 9/10 The pizzas were really good but the crust was very flimsy and couldn't carry the weight of the toppings.  The burrata on the pizzas was delicious and made the whole thing worth it.  2. Ricotta tortelloni- 8/10 very delicious, but portions are small so hard to share with 4 people.  3. Drinks here are really good and everyone enjoyed their cocktails!! 4. Brocollini- bit boring. 4/10, it was okay for an appetizer  The service was very attentive despite the restaurant being busy. The ambiance is very nice. Good vibes and lots of seating, very cozy."

We went ahead and got another round of drinks before happy hour ended since it was so good lol We then ordered the meatballs, margherita pizza, and brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts had bacon bits which was super yummy and the meatballs had a spicy sauce that was bomb too. Not to mention, service was also great and prompt.  Overall everything was tasty. Would def recommend this place for anyone looking for a cute and affordable happy hour in sf!"

        "Derek S.": "Came by for dinner the other night and it was a phenomenal world class experience. Made a reservation and our table was ready upon arrival. Frances is located in the Castro district close to the Castro Muni station and street parking seemed to be available.  Dining options appeared to be outdoor patio, counter, or main dining room. Having dined a couple times at Octavia, I had high expectations. Staff wore uniforms and some even wore a mask. Service started off with holding coats or other items in the coat closet. Opted for the $85 tasting menu and did the add-on with sourdough which was tasty with the cultured butter. The first course of appetizers as other Yelpers had mentioned, felt a touch rushed, especially with the small table. Started off with the cabbage soup which was fragrant. I loved how the grated horseradish provided nice contast to the soup. The rockfish crudo was a light and refreshing way to enjoy the first course. The roasted carrots were very sweet and fragrant. I loved how the seasoned kale was crispy, providing a fantastic contrast. The second course consisted of the gem lettuce which came out as a mega portion. Lettuce was super fresh and the vinaigrette was super light.  The pasta course might have been my favorite of the evening with perfectly al dente lumache pasta with a contrasting textures and flavors from the mushrooms and other accoutrements.  The main course consisted of a generous few slices of rather lean and well cooked pieces of NY steak. I personally would have preferred a cut of beef that had more marbling. Evening ended off with the dark chocolate brownie which was a masterpiece with contrasting textures, especially wtih the pistachio bark and pomegranate honey ice cream. ~$120/head after tax and 6% employer mandates."

        "Lisa H.": "Frances was our most visited restaurant before COVID. Sadly, something has gone really wrong because everything was off this last time we visited.  The salad was flavorless, the main dishes were so bland I could not believe this was the Frances we used to love and brag about.  Even the staff were not sophisticated as before.  The feel and taste is not a restaurant I will go back to sadly.  Way overpriced for the quality of what you get.  Pre pandemic outstanding, I wouldn't recommend it now."

It was like half cooked and I don't know not Miso cod and had a fishy taste to it. I couldn't eat it.  Everything else was so good though. There was halibut which was amazing with the peach slices. The little gem and chickory salad was amazing! I loved the reginette/la spinetta Sangiovese pasta. It had a slight lemon flavor to it and was just delightful.  I'm Not a huge fan of desert so didnt like it but everyone else at the table Loved it.  Ironically the bread and butter was also a favorite. I enjoyed this meal except for the cod. That just missed it entirely for me."

Service was good but not great given the price point - on two occasions the next course was brought to the table when our completed dish plates had not yet been removed and no one checked in with us to ask how we were doing/how the meal was. I will say however the wine pours were very generous so that was appreciated. The last course of prime rib was delicious.  I agree with another review regarding the restaurant space, it is small and feels very cramped. There's also only one restroom so more time was spent waiting in a line to use the restroom than I'd prefer during a nice meal.  Overall a really good meal and experience."

I did not see one person be standoff-Ish or make you feel like they're doing you a favor by letting you dine there.  The food was incredible. Every ingredient was fresh and the flavors went well together without being overpowering. The kale was the best kale I've ever had. One thing I would suggest is to give a little bit more of sauce with each item. They're just so good that it would be nice to have a little more of them.  Definitely recommend!"

While the food wasn't horrible, it doesn't hold a candle to the Frances of the past or even their sister restaurant Octavia. The menu was set and for the price, the amount of food and portions were not worth it. Every dish lacked any umph and all could've just used some salt. The pay for what you pour wine is no longer available which was also a bummer. The timing of the food was off the entire meal at no fault of the servers. Service was impeccable and deserves 5 stars! I will say that for $85 a person there are much better options in the city."

It was so good I regretted not getting seconds. We also ordered the original XLB and crab XLB. Personally not a fan of the crab but you can really taste the meat. The XLB was juicy and tasty.

How can I not write some prose about the crab soup dumplings! Another must get. It's delicate but is brimming with delicate balanced flavor.  I would not have been the one to ever order the Deep-fried meat dumpling but my fianc did and it's delicious. The chewy mochi like skin with a thin layer of crispy skin, ugh so good! The meat is more on the sweeter side but there is just a little bit of it so I don't mind it as much. I think of this as dessert lol. Lastly I cannot not write about the Cream Custard Buns. Ultra soft and the filling is just creamiest and sweetest. It's like biting a pillowy cloud.  Everything comes out max hot so be careful not to burn yourself. The food would tempt you no doubt but have some control and you shall be rewarded! I don't have a pic of it but another time I ordered the pepper salt chicken wings and it is also a must!"

We sat in their outdoor covered patio which was really nice and pretty sturdy, it was raining while we were there and we were dry as a bone. Our server recommended their chocolate banana bread which was super yummy, I love how banana and zucchini breads for example have so much sugar in them that probably evens out at health content the fruits or veggies had.

We ordered from the Winter 2023 menu, and everything we ordered was yummy. We ordered two starters, the mussels and caramelized onion fondue.  My goodness, the fondue. I still dream about it. The homemade chips it came was good and you can also order focaccia on the side if you want a second thing to dip in it.  The mussels were great, the broth was delicious.  Steak was cooked well, loved the creativity of the mashed potato served on bone marrow, and the creamed spinach was cooked just right.  For dessert, they were out of the chocolate cake (we're coming back for you), so we had the bread pudding instead and it was so good.  Service was excellent despite it being a busy Friday night. There was a bit of a wait for stuff but we weren't in a hurry anyway so it worked out well.  My only not so great experience was we were asked to choose still or sparkling water and I didn't realize it wasn't like sparkling water from an in house carbonator and I ended up paying $9 (!!!) for a big bottle of sparkling water. Wish I could've done without but not a big deal."

With my party of 8, we walked through the restaurant's interior to emerge in the backyard space and I heard audible gasps of joy from some in my group who were surprised in the best of ways. The backyard space is a charmer. As a Castro Street regular who is generally dining solo while in the area, Fable has never risen to the top of my list. It seems more of a splurge place than a solo dining spot but I'm happy to report that the splurge is very reasonable considering 2023 restaurant prices. Here, meal-sized salads, burgers, and other menu items can be had at lunch for under $20. This was a most pleasant surprise given the surroundings and the fact that Fable is a full-service restaurant.  I didn't take a poll, but my hunch - based on my personal experience - is that the backyard is the reason you go here and the food is nice accompaniment. My Cobb Salad ($18) was well composed and hosted a satisfying array of fresh, quality ingredients. At my table, all food was consumed but we failed to reach the \"ooh\" and \"aah\" of truly memorable food; that was reserved for the setting.  I was happily pleased with Fable. The reason to enjoy a meal there is the opportunity to sit in that attractive, leafy, green backyard. The meal is your price of admission."

The jerk pork shank seemed more braised than anything, and we were not told ahead of time that they were out of brussel sprouts and pancetta, which is part of why the dish was ordered versus another. It was a hearty portion which was nice. The halibut was the least flavorful and not a favorite."

We both agreed the Dan Dan noodles were really tasty with the perfect level of numbing spice and flavorful coated noodles! I only wish there was a little more meat/leafy greens.  The House Special Beef Rib Noodle Soup, which many other reviews rave, about was just okay. It was not temperature hot. The noodles tasted handmade but seemed undercooked (less than al dente). Soup was not as flavorful as I would have thought. The beef rib meat was tender but seemed to lack spice and seasoning and we only had half meat with a lot of bone compared to other review photos of this dish; maybe it was an off day but I probably wouldn't order this again.

The owner recommended the hand pulled noodles which is their speciality here so I went with a large bowl of Chong Qing Style Roast beef noodle soup. The wait wasn't long at all and before you know it..a large piping hot bowl of beef noodle soup was in front of me. The noodles were very fresh and because it's hand done, it was jagged edge, different widths and reminds me of a large flat rice noodles. The beef was excellent, just a small amount of fat for taste but not so much that it wasn't edible. The soup was unique to me as it reminded me of the soup base in Chinese hot pot. It was very strong, herbal flavor and you can see herbs floating around in the soup. A little too strong for me but it was very hearty. The vegetables helped balanced out the strong herbal flavor.Good try they also have rice plates, fried rice, etc. Looking forward to coming back to try some more dishes!"

Everything was very clean and I appreciate how the tables aren't preset and they bring a new set of plates and utensils as we were seated.  House special noodles with beef rib (5/5)- I love how fresh the al dente noodles were and I could tell that the noodles were freshly made. The beef rib was tender and the meat just fell off the bone. The soup was well balanced and was spicy but not to the point where it was overwhelming.  Chicken cartilage (5/5)- Well seasoned and one of my favorite items here.

The dried peas and mixed meat sauce noodles was okay, but probably would've been better to me without the peas, it kinda resembled chickpeas. The roast beef noodles tasted better, it had more flavor and with the broth, it was very tasty and savory instead of just a salty chili oil taste. Both of the noodles were fresh knife cut noodles which was a nice chewy texture. The dry fried wings were really good! It was nicely fried, crispy, flavorful. It resembles San tung wings, but better. More flavorful and crispy, yum! I would give it a 3.5 for now. Will probably try another noodle dish next time or get the roast beef noodle and definitely the wings again!"

We like the simple marinara sauce and meatball on the side (ask for no parmesan if you don't like cheese). You can also ask for less cooked (more al dente) for softer pasta like pappardelle.  Very fast service. Outdoor tables with kid's highchair available."

        "Jacqueline M.": "If you're taking a picky eater out to lunch, bring them to the Italian Homemade Company. Their pasta dishes are made to order, and you can choose from eight sauces and eight noodle types. (Basically, there's something for everyone here -- even the pickiest eater.) My go-to combo is pappardelle with bolognese, since the wide noodles are always perfectly al dente and the slow-cooked sauce is so flavorful. The pasta portion size is filling for one person. I usually end up taking some of my pasta to-go.  I've eaten here a few times with friends who tried the cassone and piadina, and they preferred my pasta to their choices. I believe they were expecting a calzone-type of dish, but ended up with a flatbread sandwich.  The dining experience is very casual: you order at the register and then seat yourself. You can pick from outdoor (covered parklet) or indoor (very limited) seating. Parking nearby is very limited. I've only experienced great, friendly service here."

Each time I've been there, I love my meal but I feel like sometimes the sauce quality changes every now and then. Sometimes I don't appreciate appreciate the meat sauce but sometimes I do! And I usually love the white sauces but sometimes I don't! In the picture, the Parmesan cream cheese sauce was a little watery. I noticed that the place is a little inconsistent in terms of the sauce to pasta to water ratio, but I can always tell that their ingredients are very fresh. You get what you pay for and I don't mind coming here."

It's the city's staple pasta place with a casual counter service, making it the ideal spot for takeout and/or a quick meal. The pasta portions are small, pricey (~$20 per plate) and simple, so don't expect toppings or an extensive menu. You're paying for quality, no nonsense pasta and sauce. My favorite combos include the Meat Ravioli with Butter Sage (SO delicious) and Gnocchi with Pesto. (P.S they don't have chicken!)"

I got the tagliatelle with pesto and I'm already planning to come back to try more things! Here you can choose what pasta and sauce you want and they will make it for you. The pasta is al dente, very thick and chewy, and the pesto tastes fresh but doesn't leave that garlic-y flavor in your mouth. The bolognese looked really good so I might try that next time. I went on a Sunday at 3.30pm and it wasn't too crowded. I also found out they have a location in Long Beach so you can try it even in SoCal!"

They specialize in pasta and sauces so the menu isn't very extensive but the pasta is fresh and tastes good. You order at the counter first and they bring the food to you so it isn't full service but the food does come quickly. There is a decent outdoor seating area outside as well if the inside gets crowded. I ordered the Tagliatelle with meatballs and there wasn't a ton of sauce on the pasta but the meat sauce was very good and the meatballs were cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for quality pasta that doesn't need appetizers or other menu options."

I will say, there was a ton of nutmeg in my sauce that overwhelmed the dish. Their ambiance isn't anything crazy but I would still come back though!"

        "Karen Y.": "Ended SF Restaurant Week by dropping by this restaurant for brunch/lunch.  They had a $30 lunch with one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert. Decided to opt for the Crispy Boudin Balls, Buttermilk Brined Fried Chicken, and Beignet.  Crispy Boudin Balls (2 pcs): love the crispiness of the exterior which contrasted nicely with the rice filling. Also could just eat that remoulade sauce on its own.  Buttermilk Brined Fried Chicken (1 pc): pretty large drumstick and I got this with a side of mashed potatoes, green beans, and cornbread. Mashed potatoes were creamy and the green beans had a really great snap to them. The tiny cornbread muffin had great texture and had pieces of corn.  Beignet (1 pc): tiny beignet with some salted caramel and chocolate sauce on the bottom of the plate. Really crispy beignet exterior and doughnut-y interior and it was a WARM beignet!! So good. The sugar just melted.  Service was pretty quick. Not sure if you could pay with cash as the host carried around a card reader and they brought that to us to pay for the meal. They took away our empty plates pretty quickly whenever we finished a plate and asked throughout the meal if everything was okay.  Hope to go back and try some of their other items like their gumbo and jambalaya."

We ordered the hush puppies and crawfish appetizers, the shrimp and grits and fried chicken entrees, and bread pudding and beignet for dessert.  The hush puppies were really amazing; it had a crispy exterior and was soft and flavorful on the inside with real corn kernels. The sauce tasted a little like a tartar sauce: creamy, and a little on the sour side. It paired really well with the fried hush puppies. We had never really eaten crawfish before, but it wasn't bad, a little on the salty side. Both entrees were delicious. The shrimp and grits had a savory sauce and the grits were creamy and yummy as well. The fried chicken was also very tender and crunchy on the outside. The mashed potatoes and green beans were also really tasty. The cornbread was disappointing though, really dry and crumbly... The beignet was delicious, crispy outside and soft inside. The caramel and chocolate sauces were also really yummy, and the chocolate wasn't too sweet. The best part of the meal, however was the bread pudding. It came out warm and it was soft and creamy without being too heavy.  Aside from the cornbread, everything was quite good, and the service was also very nice!! For restaurant week, it was $30 per person for lunch, and we paid around $80 including tip."

My favorite parts of the meal were the boudin balls with remoulade and the crispy fried chicken. The chicken was not as good as Brenda's but still very good for an Inner Sunset restaurant. My only criticism was the restaurant was very slow bringing out the food. It took over an hour for lunch and there were only 4 tables being served. But overall would be happy to visit again."

        "Amy W.": "The very definition of a hidden gem. I found this place on Yelp and my friend made a reservation for 6 people (they DID require a \"deposit\") This place has limited indoor seating due to the super cool 2 story layout. Kinda a small dining room on main level, then a balcony of seats on floor 2 that surrounds the dining room on 2 sides. Our table of 6 was all by itself on the right upper level- so perfect for us to all catch up with each other. Our FANTASTIC waiter Frederick was friendly and attentive, I wanted a lot of ice, he brought us 2 pitchers of ice!  We ordered drinks (note that due to them only have a wine/beer license, their \"cocktails\" are made with low-proof rum or vodka.) We ordered some fried okra and some corn muffins to start and share. The okra comes with a snappy dipping sauce. (Note the corn muffins are pretty small). I ordered the fried chicken (leg and thigh) with Jambalaya and the collard greens. My man had the short ribs with red beans and rice and cream cheese grits. Both entrees were heaven, but the fried chicken is one of the top 5 fried chicken dinners in SF. Very crispy and not greasy. For dessert we split all three dessert offerings: a steamed white chocolate bread pudding, pecan pie and the beignets. Of the 3 we all enjoyed the bread pudding the most. Note there is a $26 lunch special we all agreed we wanted to come back for - which includes an appetizer a entree and a dessert. (If I am remembering correctly)"

I had the eggs with grits and blacked shrimp. The cream cheese grits were lacking flavor, but acted as a good base for the blacked shrimp which is where all the seasoning on the plate was. The shrimp were nice and tender, not large nor small. Like 4 20/lb shrimp. The cornbread was very dry. I also tried the jambalaya and the gumbo. I usually love gumbo but the jambalaya was the star at our table.  The portions were small...especially for the price, more like fine dining than southern brunch. I guess our expectations were not met. Each of us had entrees and shared 4 sides ordered separately. I was still hungry after we left. I tried the vanilla scented lemonade and I was hoping for something more, I guess... I would have asked for more sugar but never got around to it. I wouldn't try this again.  Service was nice, the dining room filled up as we ate, it seems more of a lunch place than brunch. It was cute, but seems quite small. I guess get there early for seating?"

This restaurant is small but cozy. We ordered the Original Shio with an add-on bone marrow. I requested my beef to me medium well, and it came out juicy and tender. The beef was high quality, and they trimmed off almost all the fat, which I really appreciated. The broth was well seasoned but not too salty. The big beef bone was sawed down the middle lengthwise, and they give you a spoon to scoop out the marrow. The portions received were generous. The server was friendly, polite, and attentive. This spot is for beef-eaters so make sure you're okay with that before going there."

It was a bit on the spicy side though. The edamame also had some spices on the outside so it was nice.  For ramen I got the patian ramen and the flavor was so good. I could really taste the truffle in the broth. The beef was tender and the noodles retained the flavor of the broth really well. I typically don't like thick noodles for ramen but I really enjoyed this.  There was only one server so service was a bit slow but she tried her best to get to everyone as soon as she could.

I thought it was interesting, but it may be nice if they decorated or seasoned it. There aren't many ramen places that serve bone marrow, so this makes this place special. In the future, I will try out their other ramens as well. - Agedashi tofu (5/5)- Very well seasoned on the outside. Very soft and silky tofu on the inside. - Beef karage (5/5)- Really enjoyed this! The seasoning on the outside was great and I really enjoyed the chewiness of the beef inside. (*definitely recommend!) Overall, I would return again and will order beef karage again!"

The tofu had a nice kick of spice, and the beef was juicy and not tough.  However, as for the ramen, I thought it was lackluster. I had high expectations but was fairly disappointed.

The waitress did forget to get us plates for the appetizers and brought us plates for the bone marrow when we were already half way through eating.  Food: better than I thought it would be. Ordered the tofu appetizer - fried lightly and it was a different sauce than other restaurants have used and it was good. Paitan ramen with bone marrow - the broth was rich and a milky bone broth, very good!!! Bone marrow was smaller than i thought it would be but, went surprisingly well with the ramen. Beef was thinly sliced, tender, and medium rare - loved this!! Ramen portion is a bit less than some other places i've been to, but enough for me to be full!

There was a lot of meat, and they gave sides like kimchi and seasame oil (if you ask) so you can add some more flavor.

I got the spicy beef rib soup, and it came with a half-centimeter layer of oil on top. I had to spoon out all the oil before it became remotely edible. I'd never seen so much oil in a Korean soup before: it filled one of the banchan sections. The flavor was fine but a bit too spicy; at the end I couldn't finish the soup because the bottom was so concentrated with pepper flakes.  Maybe it's just not for me, but if you love super hot and super oily, the spicy beef rib soup would be a great fit for you. It's just not something I would personally ever want to eat again."

The amount of food was definitely filled us up but if you're heavy meat eater maybe opt for more than one plate of kalbijjim. The 3-4 portion kalbijjim came with 3 bowls of rice to which you can chose from either purple or white rice.  The meat was fall off the bone tender and seasoned so well! All the fixings, potatoes, and onions over rice made for a delicious bite. The bibimbap also came with a bunch a vegetables to help balance the heavy meal which served as a nice break.

        "Paolo B.": "It's been 3-years since I last ate here, and damn, the food is just as good as I remember! We were only a group of 2 so we decided to go with the galbijjim level 1 medium with the rice cakes and cheese (which is a must in my opinion). The meat is so tender and flavorful, plus all the sauce you put over the rice. It's comfort food at it's finest and perfect for a cold SF night. The serving size without the extra meat was probably good for 4 medium sized appetites, so we ended up with a good amount of leftovers. The galbijjim was as good as I remembered it, but definitely a lot more expensive. However, I do believe you can't put a price on good food, and if you really want something and it lives up to the hype, then it's worth every dim. Plus, it's a dish that I'll never be able to make on my own.  I hadn't been here in a while and I forgot that you had to order before you sat down. So when you name gets called, have your order ready, and be prepared to wait an additional 20-30 minutes before you get to your table. The waitlist you have to do in-person, and can't be done via the app, which is a bummer.  The wait on a Saturday was quoted at nearly 2 hours, but we were able to get a table under that. There's so much to walk around and see in Japantown that to fill the time was no prob. Just. be close enough to check-in once you get the text that your table is ready."

The kalbijim here is better than the one I had in Korea - it's so flavorful with the sweet and spicy sauce, and the meat is super tender. I'd definitely recommend adding the rice cakes, since they get a nice char on them from the hot stone plate. Cheese also adds a great richness and extra savory flavor. Each kalbijim feeds around 3-4 people, and the other things on their menu are pretty solid as well. Wait times get bad, but you can join the waitlist on the app without actually having to go to the restaurant, which is pretty convenient."

For a group of 8 people, I'd recommend two kalbijjim with extra meat or only one of the two with extra meat. I also love the cheese, rice cakes and noodles as extra toppings. The vegetable bibimbap is good but the portion was smaller than I expected. I think 2-3 people can share it. Unfortunately the wait times can get really long around dinner hours 5pm-7pm.

The pinze (Roman pizza) was light, flavorful, and savory. Prosciutto, arugula, Roman snow (aka pecorino Romano), EVOO. That is how you make food! Finally, I got the risotto. No words for how simple and delicious this dish is. Salsiccia, risotto, truffle. My dream is to cook this good, this fresh, this simple, and this Italian! Also, the table bread is phenomenal too! Cento anni!"

        "Vanaja U.": "If you get in here in the early evening around 6:30 you'll find that you don't have to wait too long to get a table. Give yourself 20 minutes to find parking, there are a few lots nearby that have a flat rate. Upon arriving you'll be greeted warmly by the host and the server. Everyone is friendly here!  We were asked if we were going to be sharing our dishes and they were so kind to split the dishes for us. I have never craved Italian food, most of my experiences have been meh because my taste buds crave more spice, but this place has proved me otherwise. Upon being seated and taking our orders, we are served with the best foccacia ever. It has rosemary(?), tomatoes and onion I think, and it was so delicious. Honestly I could give all the stars just for that bread. Besides that, I ordered boscaiola (pasta) with a mix of tomato and cream sauce and asked for it to be spicy. The outcome was wonderful and just a chefs kiss. I also ordered salsiccia pizza and that was good, but not as good as the pasta though. We also tried the tiramisu here-- I wasn't a huge fan of it, it tasted more like cheesecake and was very thick. Btw it can get a bit loud in here with the music and crowd. They have outdoor seating with heaters as well.  Overall, the pasta dish, friendly staff and the ambiance created a good experience for me. Would recommend to give it a try!"

        "Naina S.": "I recently dined at Roma Antica and rated it 5/5 - I absolutely loved it! This is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to. My friends and I went there to celebrate a birthday and it was the perfect choice for us. Despite the cold weather outside, the restaurant provided blankets on top of the heating lamps to make us feel comfortable. The staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to make our experience special, even singing for my friend's birthday. We ordered a few dishes including the brussel sprouts, Boscaiola pasta with pink sauce (a must-try and my favorite thing we ordered), Gnocchi with pesto, and the tiramisu which was one of the best I've ever tried. Each dish was perfectly prepared and bursting with flavor. The portions were also SOOOO GOOD especially for an Italian restaurant. You could easily make two meals out of one order.  I also highly recommend the mushroom truffle ravioli. To die for. Parking was do-able on Lombard, which was a relief. Overall, I highly recommend Roma Antica for anyone looking for an authentic Italian dining experience. It's a great spot for a birthday celebration or a romantic date night. You won't be disappointed!"

Especially warm and satisfying on a cold day. Crocchette di Melanzane(Fried Eggplant croquettes with ricotta salata & black truffle cream sauce) - the fried eggplant croquettes were fried to perfection and the sauce was really rich. The truffle taste really came through. My only complaint was that it was a tad salty. Polipo alla Griglia(Mediterranean octopus with sweet potatoes and chimichurri sauce) - the octopus was very tender. Everything worked together well. Coda Alla Vaccinara(Homemade pappardelle, slowly cooked oxtail ragu) - the pappardelle was al-dente and the oxtial ragu was fork tender and rich. Lasagna - although the lasagna was good, it's not really that special. I'd opt for other dishes next time. Overall, down-to-earth homey Italian goodness!"

We sat outside and since it was a bit chilly we got blankets and sat next to the heater. The service was amazing, the waiters are patient and have a great attitude! The appetizers came really quickly but the pasta took a bit longer since it was fresh. We ordered the brussel sprouts and bruschetta to start and really enjoyed it! The brussel sprouts were crispy and the parmesan gave it a good flavor twist. The prosciutto and burrata were super fresh as well. We ordered two pastas for main course; carbonara and rigatoni with pizza sauce. The carbonara was good (4/5), the pasta was al dente and the cream was very tasty and creamy. However the pasta with tomato pizza sauce was my favorite (5/5). This pasta dish isn't on the menu but you can request it and I highly recommend it. The sauce has cheese and it's the best red sauce I've tried in the city. Lastly, we ordered tiramisu (4/5). It was good as well and would recommend!"

We went at 7:30 pm, put our names down on the yelp waitlist, reached the top of the waitlist around 7:50, and got officially seated around 10 minutes later. Service was a bit slow, but i can't really fault them because they were absolutely packed. Free focaccia: 4.5/5 - The bread itself was fluffy and flavorful. Paired with olive oil and it was almost perfect. Would've wanted it to be warm (it came out cold) but i can't really blame them since it was packed. Pizza 3/5: Pizza seemed pretty solid, but nothing about it really spoke to me. The crust was nice, sauce was ok, cheese on top was whatever. Would probably not recommend getting a pizza here. Carbonara 5/5: This was actually my first time eating carbonara. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauce was nice and creamy, pretty much no complaints with this dish. Coda 3.5/5: Pasta was perfectly al dente similar to the carbonara. The sauce was very tomato-ey but kind of sharp (like a canned tomatoes kind of tin metal sharpness), which wasn't terrible but it took away from the experience. Overall this pasta was ok but nothing special"

This place is definitely my jam! The staff are very welcoming and friendly. The interiors of the place is very clean and has some indie vibe of the place's setting. Everything is very pleasant. I ordered a tuna sandwich and a mocha. I didn't realize the sandwich comes with some salad on the side. They all seem nutritious.  A lady, who I assume to be the owner, kept asking me how was my mocha. I said it was perfectly fine. She seemed delighted from my response. I'd definitely be back. I strongly recommend this place to anyone visiting the NoPa/Western Addition area. I just wish they'd be open more days."

Came here for a quick breakfast on a rainy Sunday morning with a friend and we were immediately seated inside! There was no wait, the interior is very cute, and the kind waitress gave us her recommendations/her favorites! We ordered their Breakfast Sandwiches as they came highly recommended and got a side of their potatoes (so yummy with melted cheese on top). I ordered their Fresh Organic OJ (definitely fresh and sweet) and it was exactly what I needed to start the morning! My friend ordered their Lavender Honey Latte and found it to be alright, but not sweet enough like she typically likes her lattes. Overall, it was a cute stop!"

        "Laura B.": "Best restaurant on divisadero by far until I write my next review! Came here on a break from yoga teacher training where we were learning all about the fear of death and how to overcome it. God, that fear is strong for me. But when I took a bite of the most perfectly seasoned breakfast sandwich on the most incredible French baguette? You know I forgot all about the ticking clock and how it struts and paces ahead of us. The oozing egg, the creamy avocado, the perfect balance of ingredients. It made one of my wrinkles disappear.  The Nioise salad is a standout as well! The salmon tasted unlike any other salmon I've had. It was tender and flavorful and perfectly cooked. I imagined the salmon in its last moments on earth, and how afraid it must have felt, and then I felt a wave of peace as I imagined it would have volunteered itself to the hook if it knew it would be part of this perfect dance of vegetables and dressing. There's an incredible dog here named Twiggy that has the poise beyond anything 100 annoying yoga teacher trainees combined could muster. It seems like he owns the place, and he owns it well. The human owners are also so charming and lovely that I hope they never do succumb to the eternal sleep that we all are destined for. They have too much incredible food and drink to give this world!"

        "April L.": "Came by on a Sunday morning around 9:30am and was seated immediately on the patio.  We got the breakfast sandwich ($16) + bacon ($3) and the dual grilled cheese ($16). The grilled cheese was our waitress's favorite and it was mine too! It melts right in your mouth and is just so satisfying. The salad addition was a nice lighter touch, although it had too much herbs for my taste. The breakfast sandwich was good too, but I will say a bit pricy for the size. I would have still been hungry if I had ate just that. The yogurt was a bit too sweet for me, I wish it was greek or something more tart and less sweet. Overall, service was friendly, but I will say a bit pricey for the portion sizes- though I do know food costs are high in general right now. Cute little neighborhood spot though!"

The grilled cheese was full of cheese and lovely tomatoes and perfectly grilled bread - it wasn't greasy and cooked to perfection. The quick was fluffy, almost like a souffl. Well balanced flavors and not too dense. Beet salad was great too. They also have lattes in many flavors, $5 IPAs and $10 mimosa's made both in our party happy.

The owners did an amazing job decorating the inside as it is so warm and welcoming upon walking in. The outdoor parklet is so cute and beautifully built as there is so much attention to detail and the wood tables and seats are stunning. The owner was so friendly and was attentive to every detail and offered suggestions, one of which was the Red Rooibos Tea latte, and it did not disappoint. We ordered the avocado toast and the breakfast sandwich. Everything was plated beautifully and the avocado toast was the best I have ever had. The amount of avocado they put on the toast is every avocado lovers dream and it was perfectly green, not a brown spot to be seen. Every bite had so much flavor, it is a definite repeat. The breakfast sandwich was amazing! The croissant was a perfect balance of soft with the just the right amount of crunch. The egg was cooked to perfection, not too runny or dry. Absolute perfection. The bacon had amazing flavor and added the perfect crunch to every bite. We loved everything about this restaurant and cannot wait to return."

They're still getting up and running so service is friendly and welcoming, but a little slow at the moment. Don't hold it against them! Just kick back with a latte and enjoy the warmth and neighborhood vibe."

It was a little cold but there were heaters that helped a bit. The pulled pork tacos were pretty solid, came with a lot of meat and was well seasoned. My friends in my group ordered a cheeseburger that came with the tastiest paprika flavored fries. My cocktail was pretty tasty, I'd recommend the hot apple cider one if your cold and sitting outside.

Two piece fried chicken: this was all of our fav dish tonight! came with 2 giant pieces of boneless fried chicken thighs drizzled in sriracha maple syrup. the chicken was incredibly juicy and crispy, which complemented well with the kimchi mac n cheese and mexican style cheese corn Gochujang crispy wings: was so crunchy that it was a bit hard. loved the sweet and savory flavor and not spicy at all Squash: beautiful presentation but was honestly so confused what i was eating. i think it was roasted squash on a bed of firm tofu. wish the squash was more cooked and unsure about the flavor combos, but not bad  Double cheeseburger: seemed pretty standard. came with nicely seasoned fries"

My first visit was for a friend's birthday, so I knew it was trustworthy from the start. The venue was a bit smaller than I expected, so seating was a bit tight, but the staff fit our group of 10-12 in a back booth with ease. The menu, although a bit small, had some great options that I think anyone could pick from. Their drinks blew everything else out of the water! The Lowrider (90% sure that's what I ordered lol) was rich, flavorful, and just strong enough to leave me feeling warmer than when I arrived. I jumped for the pulled pork tacos, which--although the three tortillas look small--the portions of meat and salsa are very generous. The rest of the table ordered just about every other entree on the menu, and I didn't hear anything but \"mmm\"s and \"yum\"s the entire night. Although they were very busy, the staff checked in with us periodically throughout our reservation and made our time there very enjoyable. Looking forward to a round two soon!"

We had one, and there was a separate checkin line, so that was nice. We were seated right on time. The indoor seating is tight. We were next to a party of 7 I believe. It was almost like we were part of their party, so if tight seats are not ok, maybe request an outdoor table. Those had plenty of room and had heaters. They had a special holiday cocktail menu when we went. I ordered the hot drink, which was perfect for the rainy day. Between us 2 we ended up getting the duck fat fries, wings, and the smoked tuna dish. The fries were good - nice and crispy - but I probably wouldn't get them again unless we were sharing with more people. It's a large portion, and in hindsight, I would have rather tried another small plate instead. The wings were good, with a hint of sweet and spice. The smoked tuna was interesting. I don't think I have ever had something I could compare it to. It still had the texture of something like a poke, but tasted like it was cooked. Definitely worth a try. Loved the chewy farro as an alternative to rice. Our server was very friendly, even though she seemed very busy. Overall everything was great. Good value and some unique options. Smaller menu, but good variety, with items for picky eaters too. I would love to come back and try something on their regular cocktail menu and some of the other food options."

Horsefeather is doing a holiday themed menu for the month of December so wanted to give it a try.  Drink: Rebel without a Clause - very spirit forward, sweet and definitely boozy, garnished with a dried orange slice and biscoff cookie. Not quite what I was expecting from the description so a bit disappointed.  Service: I think they usually don't have guest in the standing area so it was a bit challenging getting service.  Overall, this visit was a bit lackluster.

We also got the black bean noodles and green beans (a dish i always love), but the quality was just not there.

I've never seen a white board used as a waitlist but luckily people don't erase your name or anything.  I checked to see if ordering online would be quicker than waiting for a table but it said the food would be ready more than an hour from the time we got there so we decided to wait for a table anyways. We were seated faster than we would have gotten our food but it did take a while to order and have our food brought to us since the restaurant was busy.  I'm rating this place 3 stars because we wanted to order just the dry fried chicken wings. I saw that they had a minimum order requirement per person and thought that the wings would have still met this requirement but the server told me to order more food. She suggested ordering rice which was an extra $3. Other than that, the food was pretty good and service was decent. I don't think I would want to wait longer than 20-30 minutes to eat here though.  The wings were delicious and flavorful. It reminded me of Korean fried chicken wings which I love. However, I would have preferred it less spicy but if you love spice than you'll definitely enjoy it.  They also have restrooms here which were pretty clean. Next time I stop by, I would probably just take the food to go and eat it at the Golden Gate Park. Although, eating wings can get a little messy since they are sticky."

When we went to San Francisco this past weekend we didn't expect the out-the-door waiting list. Well, there was really nowhere to sit and wait inside the restaurant so everyone waiting to be seated were outside braving the cold, including us. An employee would come outside and yell out your number when it's your turn.  We jotted down our name on their whiteboard and waited outside with the masses until our number was called. 35 mins later... we were finally seated inside. I texted and asked my co-worker what she would recommend... she said to get their Original Dry Fried Chicken.  \"Rated Top 18 Best chicken wings in SF by Eater\" Top 21 Best chicken wings in America\" We ordered Beef With Green Onions which was basically non-spicy Mongolian Beef, Pork Fried Rice, and their Original Dry Fried Chicken (what they are known for). It was good but definitely not dry... it was crunchy, saucy, sticky and sweet. Not what I expected.  It was busy, loud and bustling inside and if you sat by the door you would get a whiff of the cold San Francisco wind each time the door opened. Service was slow. Review #2931"

Finally on my third try I was able to come when the restaurant is open. Parking is a little bit difficult but totally worth coming. If you come during lunch rush or dinner rush, expect a wait around 30 minutes because the restaurant is small and will only fit about 50 people. It's your traditional Chinese restaurant lay out with loud noise and aunties and uncles lowkey rushing to clean the tables, but that what makes the foods taste even better. They are known for their fried chicken wings and it totally makes sense. We ended up ordering two plates of the fried chicken wings. The wings were crispy and juicy. The sauce that coated the wings was delicious. I would recommend getting some rice on the side because it could be a little salty eating it on its own. The mushu pork was also delicious. I've never tried it before but it was a pleasant, tasty surprise. It had cabbage and egg stir fried with your choice of meat, and came with 4 wrappers and hoisin sauce.  Overall, I would totally come back and eat here again. I might consider ordering takeouts next time so I can eat in comfort."

There was a long line but my niece actually made a reservation ahead of time so we just went ahead inside on their one and only private room which is good for 8 people. But there's only 7 of us which is the minimum to reserve the spot. They will not let you in unless the whole party is complete. Giving it 3.5 stars mainly because of the service. They're fast, attentive to your orders, and keep checking on your table. I guess they do that too so that you can finish your eating since there's always a line waiting outside lol. In regards to the food, I like it but not too much because I noticed all the dishes are on the sweeter side. I'm not a fan of sweet dishes though. Sorry. To each his own. We ordered hit and sour soup(salty and lacking of sourness) string beans(ok), shrimp dumpling(good), regular noodles(ok), honey walnut prawns(ok), sweet and sour beef(ok), fried calamari(not good for me cause it's sweet and has sauce), and their infamous chicken wings(ok). Yes, I do like the sweet and sour beef but taste like it's still missing something though and their regular noodles. Their black bean noodles is too salty for me. I noticed most people who goes there are Generation Z'ers and Millennials. Im not saying food were terrible but not amazing either. I've tasted and tried better Chinese cuisines. Will have to come back to try of their other items on the menu. I always want to try the second time around for more reviews. For now, it's just overhyped for me."

It was the perfect spiciness to eat with rice and I liked how thick the sauce was so it coated the chicken really well. The chicken was fried well and were pretty juicy inside. The green beans complemented the dish really well, especially since they're fried but I love the flavor and garlic they infused into it. Overall can't go wrong with these two items!"

The food was fresh, flavorful, and delicious. **Make sure you ask for house made noodles!** The wings were everything you'd expect them to be. This is why we came and we were not disappointed. Can't wait to come back!"

        "Melanie N.": "Stopped by after leaving the Golden Gate Park. Not a bad walk. We went inside and wrote our name down on a white board next to a number. Remember that number because they'll call it out when your table's ready. It's super cold waiting outside so when the 4 seats in front of the entrance freed up we rushed in. We waited 45 minutes till we got a table.  We ordered the Original Dry Fried Chicken and the Vegetable Egg Rolls. The Dry Fried Chicken was moist with sauce so no worries about it being too dry. The Vegetable Egg Rolls were legit lettuce in the egg roll so the menu is vegetarian friendly. Not very enticing compared to the Fried Chicken but the waitress required us to order either rice or something else on the menu.  The Dry Fried Chicken has a good flavor but it will burn when it leaves your body so not sure if I want to go through that again.  The service was ok. The restroom was clean."

        "Jack B.": "I'm so full that I can barely move. Everything was so tasty that leftovers just weren't happening. Fresh and vibrabt flavors on everything. -Mapo Tofu: amazing sauce, silky tofu and flavorful minced pork. Spicy but not overwhelmingly so -szechuan dumplings: since this was a takeaway order they were smart and put the sauce on the side. Texture and flavor was on point. I asked for extra spicy and they were kind enough to give me extra of the regular sauce and then a container of extra special spicy. This was the standout dish that I will be coming back for again and again! -steamed rice: slightly sweet and fluffy, perfect to off set the spicy dishes -shrimp chow mein: delicious all around, crisp veggies and succulent, sweet shrimp. My only critique would be that I would be willing to pay a little more for more shrimp. 5 was good, but just a few more would bump up the value. But like I said at the beginning, it was all so dang good that we ate every last bit of it."

        "Adam B.": "Tried this after watching some dogs in Duboce Park. Conveniently located at the edge of the Haight an the edge of Castro. A large menu of made-to-order dim sum, so everything is fresh when it gets to your table. Classic Pot Stickers: These are indeed classic. Crispy flat bottom and doughy everywhere else. The filling was just pork and veggies. Nothing novel or innovative, but very classic. Thai Tom Yum XLB: Tasted like a regular Xiao Long Bao, to be honest. Nothing wrong with that since I love the soup (i.e. liquid pork fat goodness) and the porky meatball inside. Kinda wish they offered the vinegar and fresh ginger strands with this to help cut the richness. Shrimp Toast: Love how crispy and full of flavor this is. Like a Chinese doughnut, but with a nice vein of ground shrimp in the middle. Plus that creamy mayo sauce on top is the perfect pairing. Sichuan Hot & Spicy Dumplings: A group favorite at the table. The spicy and slightly numbing Sichuan sauce was a great way to liven up the little dumpling. Pairs great against all the doughy wrapper. The sauce was so good I actually used the leftovers on a potsticker! Fried Crab Roll: Like a crab rangoon, but in a fried spring roll wrapper. I kinda liked this format more because the dough was lighter and less greasy. Also, felt like you got more creamy filing. Beef Chow Mein: A standard. Not dim sum, but who doesn't love a little noodles? Fresh veggies and a decent amount of beef."

Honestly, for the lower haight area, the food here feels reasonably priced for a city! the portions are also pretty good so was pleased to say that - service. the service was extremely quick and the waiter did a good job of asking what we wanted. the food honestly was okay, doesn't feel super authentic and I think dumpling home and dumpling house are more worth it. we got - spicy shao mai -- okay, the quality of the meat was pretty strong, could benefit from more rice wine or something - fish and mushroom dumpling -- alright, extremely fishy - spicy wontons -- just okay, I think the sauce could be stronger. there was a hint of mala that was good but could be better"

        "Thu N.": "So excited about this new addition to the Haight neighborhood! Dumpling Union is a spacious and chic new dim sum spot with an extensive menu that it'll be hard not to splurge on. - Spicy XLB: I'm not usually the biggest fan of pork, but my friend and I both LOVED these. These are pretty little purple XLBs filled with pork and spicy broth -- cooked to perfection (and they don't stick on the little tray!) - Green Beans: SO satisfying with the fried garlic and shallots. I literally couldn't stop munching on these. Perfect to share! - Barbecue Pork Buns: Soft on the outside, sweet and meaty on the inside. A pretty solid bun! - Classic Potstickers: Also a solid option -- the potsticker is firm and slightly crispy, with juicy pork on the inside. Ordering is done via app but the check is physical. Service was super attentive, clearing our plates quickly and refilling our water. I'm a huge fan of the interior decor, utensils, and even the custom bill holder. Everything about this place is so cute! Would love to visit again to get some more of those XLBs."

Sat fairly quickly but once it's ruining normally I'd say you might have a wait. We know they have an upstairs that wasn't open when we arrived.  You ordered on a QR code pay after. The place looks great. Even the tableware is beautifully thought over. Everyone was pleasant, service was as quick as can be for first runs. Items we shared: We loved the chow mein. Great flavor, enough portion for either 2 or 1. Szechuan wonton felt like too much chili oil for my liking with not enough outer spice. But plenty inside to give you that numbing Szechuan flavor. Spicy pork dumpling was the star. Great soup taste, perfect dough, great pork flavor, not spicy at all. Wagyu dumpling was our 2nd favorite. Great flavor, dough was steamed and left plain to not take away from other flavors. Soup inside also flavorful. Potstickers not pictured were all evenly fried. Not oily, great crisp. Inside is moist, with great flavor. (6 pieces) Overall, we are coming back and excited to try the other items on the menu."

The nice lady told us that they weren't open yet but to come back on saturday for their grand opening. It was very busy and a little rough around the edges of course but the food was very very delicious.  Highly recommend: Spicy pork xlb Sichuan hot and spicy dumplings Bbq pork bun Three flavored dumplings  Pro tips: - Don't get distracted by the ordering ipad, thats for takeout only. Flag down a waiter to get seated. - Scan QR code and order food through your phone I'm sure once the staff gets into the groove, it'll be perfect. Very minor improvements but everything was so affordable for the quality. Imagine better than Din Tai Fung but half the price."

Ordered the veggie dumplings, three kind dumplings, green beans and mapo tofu vegetarian style. Everything slapped.  The green beans came out first and we're PACKED with flavors. They were hot in temperature which was perfect for the cold day. Seasoned/sauced to perfection, didn't need any additional adders. The mapo tofu had great spice, great portion size and was banging. The dumplings were solid and I def appreciated them more with the soy sauce/chili oil combo.  Service staff extremely friendly and accommodating. The place looks like it's already getting packed pretty quickly around dinner time - people must be hearing the good vibes.  Only tip would be to have the option to order via the website with vegetarian substitutions built in. I had to verbally ask the staff about editing the order to have no pork. Other than that... chef kiss great!"

The soup dumplings were nothing to write home about. Got the combo. The purple tasted the best but I don't know which flavor that was. They came in the metal tins which I think is cheating. A few of them ripped while trying to remove them from the tins. I also asked for ginger and vinegar and rather than saying ok, they make a fuss about how they don't normally provide it but can make some if I want. Which I did.  I'll be back and will try some more items. It kinda met my reduced expectations. They have room for improvement and possibly to get worse. Will see..."

We got the honey walnut shrimp, cucumber salad, Shanghai chubby noodles, and garlic string beans with chicken. Everything was really good and the portions were huge!  The cucumber salad was fresh, crunchy and the sauce they use tasted like a combination of vinegar, garlic and soy sauce. The honey walnut shrimp was crispy on the outside and the shrimps were big. They also didn't skimp on the sauce. The string beans were also fried really well and still had the crunch when we got home, which makes or breaks this dish. This was probably my favorite dish! The Shanghai chubby noodles were pretty standard, I wished I added meat to it though.  I would definitely be back again!!"

I found this place on a whim, hoping to have a warm XLB while dining in but unfortunate that it's take out only.didn't look at the reviews.  You enter this small restaurant and order off an iPad. It's a bit busy so ordering ahead is going to save you a lot of time. The customer service is pretty much nonexistent. You order your food and you leave. I am sure they prioritize their online orders and are more profitable this way instead of having dine in options. Can't blame em I guess.. I don't have much to say but here are some little key points.  Take out only Card payment is preferred  They had a variety of gluten free options and veggie options. (Don't eat the sauce if you're GF). Decently priced ($11-$16 pp) Avoid lines and order online before your arrival  Parking isn't the best but that's expected in SF."

Street parking was easy to snag near the restaurant and the order was ready on time for pickup. I ordered the XLB and Shanghai chubby noodles. The XLB were delicious! Definitely my favorite item of the 2 and I highly recommend. Super fresh and full of flavor and the soy vinegar sauce on the side was yummy too. The noodles were also good, a fairly simple dish with super thick and fresh noodles. Not immensely flavorful, but tasted great with a little soy sauce and hot sauce added. Overall this spot is great for casual takeout and I liked that they were open fairly late as well. Will definitely return for the delicious XLB!"

I like the various vegetarian options that are normally only available with meat. I ordered through Yelp for pickup. I noticed a big price difference ordering through different apps FYI. The order was ready promptly and pick up was easy.  *Bouncy boa buns were filled with greens. They were pillowy and the filling held up nicely. I was so happy to see a veggie bun option. Next time I want to try the black sesame buns. *Veggie noodles were excellent. Not greasy and had a nice variety of fresh veggies. The container was mostly filled.  *Hot and sour soup was a bit disappointing because it was very thick and gloppy. I thinned it out and it tasted so much better. I know there's corn starch to thicken it but that was way too much. *Steamed veggie dumplings were homemade. They were good but a little dried out around the edges.  *Sesame balls are my favorite and these were the perfect ending to the meal.  I would order again because the prices are decent and the quality of ingredients are good. It's a good neighborhood restaurant for quick take out made with care."

        "Natalie M.": "Had heard about this restaurant from my nephew and his girlfriend, who gave us the cookbook for Christmas, along with a meal. We finally got to go with them for a fun night out. No reservations taken, so I was worried about a Saturday night dinner, but we got there at 9pm (because we had a late lunch) and there was no wait at all! A casual atmosphere, with several tables around us having dogs, which we thought was very cool. So there is a QR code at the table, and it isn't just for looking at the menu, it is also for ordering. So we all got it, to look at the menu and one of us did the ordering. It was a little confusing and impersonal, to not have a server available to answer questions. Also, once we placed our order, the food came out super fast! We were all sharing everything we ordered, so it was a bit overwhelming but to their credit, when we asked if things could be slowed down, it happened immediately. I guess if everyone is ordering their own meal, it would make sense for everything to come out at once, but since we were sharing all the items, it was too much too fast. This is where a personal interaction would have been helpful. On to the food and drink! Everything was delicious. The ceviche tostada was spectacular. So fresh! The carnitas were delicious, but needed a little salt, which they brought. The empanadas, market salad, cauliflower Al pastor were all good too. The pork quesadilla was so filled, it looked more like a giant taco than a quesadilla! We all ate until we were stuffed, and had plenty to take home for dinner tomorrow. Really enjoyed my spicy \"Sweet Heat\" cocktail, with tequila, pineapple juice and habanero. A good modern-Mexican meal."

        "Kevin R.": "I've been here now three times with a few years between visits and my opinion has remained the same: it's way overhyped. I've gotten used to overpaying for most my meals in SF, but if I'm gonna pay it, I still expect quality. On this last visit, I paid $54 for 2 small tacos, an empanada and 2 drinks of average quality at best  On the positives: the service was very fast. It's a busy restaurant and I expect that they try to turn over tables quickly. The QR code ordering is nice because everyone can order separately and no need to split the check later. For our appetizer, a friend got the Totopos con chile. It has a bit of a kick but tons of flavor. Kind of reminded me of a Dorito covered in cheese The rest of the meal wasn't as exciting. The nopalito margarita was very basic. A shot of well tequila and margarita mix doesn't need to be $13. I expect some kind of unique flare to command that price.  The chicken tacos (Panuchos de pollo) didn't have much flavor; the chicken was dry. Way over packed with cabbage - to the point that you need to eat half the taco filling with a fork before you can pick it up. Not saying that the amount of taco content is a bad thing, but maybe make the size of tortilla proportionate. The empanada also wasn't impressive. It had an overpowering spice with no real flavor outside of that. It was also messy to eat. Maybe because the contents were dry and didn't really hold together like it would in a typical empanada. In this, it all just kind of falls out  I hate being the guy to write reviews like this, but I also get so annoyed when a place like this can get popular, jack up the prices and then not meet expectations. They're still popular and people keep coming back but there's far better Mexican food in the city at a more reasonable price"

        "Brett G.": "Trendy but casual bougie LatinX spot. Overall, food is beautiful but lackluster and not impressed with service. Arrived about an hour before close for a quick snack and grabbed a seat at the bar. Place was packed late on a weekday so I imagine reservations are mandatory on weekends. Food's appearance was amazing. I ordered the cauliflower al pastor and ceviche tostada. Cauliflower came out in a rich orange sauce with slices of mandarin and a sprinkle of cheese. While the sauce was great, the fruit taste typically found in Pastor didn't cut through and the cauliflower was a little undercooked, lacking the character or snap that I was expecting as it was a little soft and overwhelmed by the sauce. The tostada came with marinated fish, cabbage, avocado, etc. as expected. The actual base was so thinthat it may as well not have been there. The fish was decent although the texture was slightly less flaky than I like for ceviche. The sheer massive amount of cabbage overwhelmed the dish, however. While it added some crunch, usually the base fills that role and its watery flavor diluted the fish taste. The avocado/guacamole was also a little liquidy and overall the dish was so overpowered by the lime and cabbage combo that it really wasn't that flavorful. Very disappointing. While I had ordered at the bar an hour before close, I didn't get anyone to come by to fill my water or check on me outside of initially giving me my drink (bartender) and dropping off food (wait staff) until I had been long finished and was about to close my tab."

The pulled pork was okay - perhaps the team was having an off day .. but I'd give it another chance as the rest of the foods (chicken mole in particular ) was excellent - and came served w those fresh tortillas for your own mole tacos. Whatever you order, I recommend getting an extra side of salsa and crema.  Margaritas? 45$ for a pitcher serving 4. Better off ordering individual ones for variety."

We decided to share an order of beef mandoo and half and half chicken wings, yangnyeom and ganjang. The dumplings were scalding hot but good! The chicken was super crispy and well-flavored. I preferred the ganjang, but that's probably because I'm not a fan of mixing sweet with savory. The chicken came with small piles of corn coleslaw, pickled radish, and fries.  Overall, the food was good and it was a very reasonably priced meal for two people. If we had each ordered a plate of wings, we'd be stuffed -- as it was, we were comfortable but definitely not full.

        "Mike C.": "This business popped on my radar in one of Yelp's weekly update about hot new businesses. It also popped my curiosity since I recognized the address and had no idea about this business at this location. This area has been up and coming for a while before everything changed in 2020. With Michelin restaurants getting acclaim and new popular businesses (boba and bagels, anyone?), there is no shortage of food options within this block. While running an errand at this particular center, I walked by and was shocked to find this diamond in a rough. Knowing that I'd be in the area, I called in my order a little after noon and was quoted a pickup time twenty minutes later. Having already eaten lunch before my errands, I ate the food over the next week. The first item that I ate was the fried chicken, half half, Yangnyeom and Ganjang chicken with bones (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lYoAsTzZsGSCj19Qx6M4xA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot</a>), which translates to sweet and spicy and soy sauce chicken respectively; the order comes with a delicious corn cole slaw and pickled radish. I highly recommend eating them there as the skin was a bit soft after reheating in my toaster oven. I may try using a higher heat next time. The cole slaw was different as I'd never had one with corn which adds a sweet element. The purple radish were tangy and bold. I also bought a lunch combo with Supreme Yangnyeom chicken plate (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rfgrLiXyMTjfrGdewgt4Hg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot</a>) home; the meal comes with purple rice, dumpling, potato (tater tots), corn cole slaw, and pickled radish. Besides being a substantial amount of food, all items were tasty. The meat was boneless which made this a lot easier to pair with the purple rice as I enjoyed that sweet and spicy sauce. Again, with the number of fried foods, this is probably better eaten dine in or shortly after picking it up. There was only a single person eating in the left dining area. A family of three walked in when I first arrived but, after getting something from my car, they weren't there. Perhaps they placed a takeout order too. Big thanks for Yong, the young lady who put my order together besides giving me a cup of ice water as I waited near the entrance. Likely because of my order size, she also generously gifted me a two-liter bottle of Coca Cola. Looking forward to coming back when infection numbers decline more."

        "David A.": "I went to Arang years back but they have completely revamped the place. Not sure if it's new ownership or if they just wanted something different, but the update is welcome.  This place is now mostly KFC (Korean Fried Chicken)-type dishes. However, I was more interested in the section of the menu where everything was a soup and began with \"Dak\". Everything tempted me but I tried the Dak Gaejang - spicy chicken soup with vegetables. It was the first time I've seen this on a Korean menu and is basically Yuk Gaejang with Dak (chicken) instead of yuk (beef). Broth was nice and savory and they were generous with the chicken. Please note that their broth is also made with beef bone marrow, although I don't mind since this added an extra dimension of flavor. Also available: Assorted chicken soups with rice, rice cake, noodles, beef dumplings, and both beef dumplings & rice cake.  Side dishes weren't a lot (sauced onions/jalapenos & salad), but maybe in line with KFC places. The purple rice that comes with everything is nice though, since it's actual purple rice."

Usually most Burmese restaurants are either too oily, not pasty enough, etc. and I will say that nothing will ever match or beat my mother's homemade cooking, but this place was the closest anyone has been to that level!  Ordered all the basics, tea leaf salad (during the coup, which still goes on quite frankly, there wasn't enough supply so they used regular salad), tofu tower, kou swe thout (noodle salad, and more proteins. Thank you to the hardworking waiters and I overall just love the ambiance here, especially at night.

        "Chris D.": "Heard a lot about this place and they had a menu during restaurant week. Thought it was time that I finally tried it out. Service is good with our server coming to ask us how the food was. They also had the salad tossed in front of us (I've heard this is a burmese thing but it's still cool). We sat outside so can't really tell about the ambiance inside but outside seems like ur casual restaurant.  We decided to do the restaurant week menu with 1 app, 1 salad, 2 entrees, and dessert. Platha and Dip: Super fluffy and buttery platha with a nice slight crispy exterior. The dip was this mild light curry. The platha doesn't really soak up the curry as much but overall still a good dish. 4/5 Tea Salad (not pictured): This was a showstopper. I've never had a salad that was so well rounded. Texture, taste were phenomenal. Nice crispy textures from these friend shallots (?), sunflower seeds and cashews. Freshness from the tomato. The sauce resembled a more earthy pesto. tossed together, everything was so well balanced. 5/5 Basil Pork Belly: Great flavor and use of spices. Wasn't too overpowering the basil and chili flavors worked really well together. Pork itself was a little on the fattier side so involved a lot more chewing. Not really the meatiest. 4.5/5 Mango Chicken: My least favorite dish. Chicken was just plan shredded chicken that didn't absorb the mango sauce that well. Tasted one dimensional to me. 3/5 Coconut Pudding Fritter: Very lightly sweetened and crispy. If the server didn't tell us it was pudding I would have thought that it was fried dough. The coconut ice cream that it came with was phenomenal. Really strong coconut flavor that wasn't too sweet and had coconut bits in it as well. 4/5 We also ordered other stuff from the menu. Mango Lassi: A tad too sweet and too much mango flavor. Don't really taste as much yogurt that you would normally taste in mango lassi. 4/5 Coconut Thai Tea: You're average thai tea bjt enhanced with coconut flavor. Was a nice balance and the coconut taste cut the sweetness. 4.5/5 Passion fruit Sorbet (not pictured): Very strong passion fruit flavor but with that came a lot of tartness. It needs a little sweetness to balance the tartness. Also a little icy. 3.5/5 Overall a really good experience and I can understand the hype of this restaurant. I would recommend anyone who wants to try out burmese food for the first time."

        "Darina H.": "My family (party of 4) arrived when they first opened so we didn't have to wait long to get a table. There were no reservations available online so it appears to be first come, first serve.  We did street parking which was relatively easy - we might have lucked out though because this whole area seems very bustling!  The staff were very communicative and stated that when we arrived, they would get our table ready and call us when our table was ready. For our dinner we ordered the following items: - Garlic Noodles (with chili sauce on the side) for kids! Did someone say noodles?! Our kids just love garlic noodles and it was nice they could do the chili on the side. Thank you!  - Fried Yellow Bean Tofu - house made tofu made with fresh yellow beans. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Served with soy-chili sauce. This was delicious and very flavorful. Kids loved this one too.  - BSprouts - fried brussels sprouts with furikake, popped rice and cheese (HOLY GUACAMOLE - this dish was AMAZING to the 100th degree). If loving this wrong - I dont want to be right!!!  - Large Tea Leaf Salad (to share) - hands down one of my favorite burmese dishes ever and this one DID NOT DISAPPOINT! Can I just have one everyday?! Loved that they mixed the goods in front of you and the ingredients are SO FRESH!  - Sesame Tofu - shared with the kids! Crispy and delicious!  - Eggplant With Garlic Sauce - yummy in my tummy! Great to add to your order if you're looking for additional greens with so much flavor!  Overall- a great experience. Timing is everything! It's a small restaurant - just know there is one bathroom and you may have to wait in line if you need to use it. The staff were all attentive and friendly despite the restaurant being very busy! Our family very much enjoyed our experience here! THANK YOU FOR THE BOMB FOOD!"

        "May L.": "One of my favorite restaurants in SF. Food is incredible, and every time I come here I always order the chili lamb because it's the best! Gets popular during dinner, so it's good to come early to join the waitlist. Very friendly and attentive service. Inside is cozy, and if you sit outside they even offer you a blanket to keep warm. Chili lamb: 10/10 This dish was life-changing. Some of the most delicious lamb I've ever had. The meat is tender, it basically melts in your mouth. It's full of rich spices and juicy flavor. A perfect blend of savory, sweet, and spicy. Sweet grilled onions balance out the savory meat. Chilis add some heat but it's just the right amount.  We ordered the large size which turned out to be huge. We still managed to finish it because it was that yummy. But for the sake of your stomach, would recommend sticking to regular size if just sharing between two. Coconut rice: 10/10 Fluffy rice with a sweet milk coconut taste. So good. Platha dip: 9/10 The curry dip is very creamy and also has a rich coconut flavor. Only wish it were bigger. Comes with layered bread that is similar to the Chinese scallion pancake texture. Each bite is warm and buttery goodness."

        "Amanda M.": "This Burmese restaurant is super popular in sf. We came here on a weekday night and there's still a long wait, waited 40 mins get in for a group or 4. The host was super attentive to us as we waited and kept us updated about the seating and even remembered our names.  Once we were seated we were immediately able to order. We ordered a tea leaf salad, chili lamb, superstar shrimp, basil pork belly, nan gyi dok and a black rice pudding for dessert. The food tends to have a sweet spicy contrasting flavor to it which was good. The favorite was the black sesame rice pudding. For the other dishes the chili lamb and the superstar shrimp were good, the pork belly had a kick to it. The nan gyi dok was the only dish that was lighter in flavor. Everything else had some spice or other flavors. We also got some coconut rice and regular rice. The coconut rice is a must to eat with the meal. Overall, I think this restaurant serves good Burmese food."

What had happened was the host didn't plan on sealing our group of nine, but only plan for only a certain amount I forget what it was. We had to wait outside not sure where to wait, there was hot jasmine tea by the outdoor dining stalls. After a few minutes, they finally combined and tables and seated us. A few of the pictures attached in this review are the sticky fingers, sesame chicken, which was the chicken version of the Sticky Fingers, the tea, leaf salad and we had a bunch of other options that we're not pictured here. I love the mango shrimp, but the garlic shrimp was too garlicky! I also enjoyed the ginger lemonade, which was not too gingery My cousin got a eggplant, tofu dish. It was also pretty good, and I think we got this noodle dish that was not bad for what it was.  I did see a last minute walk in, and it sucks that they were rushing the guy to make a selection before the kitchen could close I also like that the bathroom had a green light for open usage and a red light for occupied use. All in all fabulous experience, just some recommendations, even though we came in at closing"

The tea leaf salad was my favorite- I loved the texture that the peanuts added and it was a savory and delicious. I wasn't expecting to enjoy a salad as much as I did! The nan gyi dok was okay- I don't think the flavor was super strong and I didn't like it as much as the salad.  We also came here around 1pm on a Sunday and there was no wait. However the wait can reach an hour in the evening on weekends so call ahead about the wait time! Service is great and they offer to mix the food for you"

Everything tasted fantastic -- the seasoning is just right and the grilled flavor is appetizing. I ended my meal with a wonderful Mont Blanc, a most underrated dessert.

We were only planning to order one round of skewers, but we ordered a second and then a third. Everything we ordered was really good and you could really taste the flavor from the grill, so I don't think you can go wrong with whatever you choose. We were able to try a good assortment of both the meats and veggies. One stand out for us was the shiitake mushrooms; they were amazing and honestly, the veggie options were maybe even better than the meat. Don't ignore the matcha salt either! Definitely added a lil something to each bite.  For drinks, I ordered a matcha cocktail, which had a sake base. Super unique and yummy, I haven't seen matcha cocktails on a menu anywhere else. They also had a matcha IPA that I'd love to try next time! It's a pretty tiny spot, but would be a fun place to go with a small group before going out."

        "Sherwin C.": "It's quite amazing that Moku quietly serves some of the most delicious food that you'll find in the area in a small restaurant with maybe enough room for a few dozen people. With that, the service here is very personal and you'll get your food super fresh from the grill, which is maybe only 10 feet away from where you are seating. For the quality and flavor of the food served, the prices are surprisingly reasonable as you'll definitely have a memorable experience. The kushiyaki is what most people will be going here for and the cuts are top quality while the portion sizes is fairly generous. I would definitely order the hotate which features melt-in-your-mouth tender scallops which are paired nicely with the garlic butter. The Buta Kashira and Pork Cheek both do a great job of highlighting the tenderness and intense flavor of these portions of the pig face, with minimal flavoring to avoid distracting from the flavor of the meet.  The fish is also great here as well. The bincho tataki as a surprisingly flavorful preparation of white tuna with seared chili and ponzu that really helped to bring out the flavor of the fish which was offered in a generous portion size. In a future visit I'd definitely love to try more of these options as the flavor combinations sounded amazing. Overall, a must visit if you're in the area. You may have to wait in line for a bit, but the food is well worth the patience."

I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. My bf and I shared 5 skewers and a beer. We ordered the grilled squid, okra, chicken, scallops, and shiitake mushrooms. Everything was honestly so good - perfectly grilled, juicy and flavorful. My favorites were the okra, chicken and scallop. I thought the squid was good but not worth the price while I missed the natural flavor of my shiitake when they added the bonito flakes on top. Paired with a Sapporo beer, the food really hit the spot and took me back to Tokyo. Space is quite small, probably seats at most 20 people comfortably. The guy serving us was super friendly and joked around a lot."

        "Ann P.": "Yakitori in SF generally leaves more to be desired- but I'm happy to say that Moku breaks that mold. The selection of yakitori here is varied in terms of meats- chicken, beef, pork, seafood- so you won't find the rarer parts of chicken here if that's what you're after. That said, the limited menu is executed very well- with that characteristic charcoal char (alliteration anyone?). One thing to note- it's not well ventilated so you may come out smelling like a juicy skewer yourself!  Skewers: -Chicken heart: (my favorite- and done better than most places I've been too) -Chicken thigh: solid -Scallops: delicious and sweet -Pork Belly: skip, I think this could have been more well done -Oyster mushrooms: delicious!  It's small but not well known yet so there was no wait when we arrived around 5:30 on a weekday. Tip: if you're into squid, the grilled squid here is A+.  My go-to place for yakitori in SF- and definitely reminiscent of Japan."

Not terrible but also not mind blowing. - Grilled mackerel: This was great and had a nice grilled texture but was also pretty standard. - Sliced whelk: Ordered this to be experimental and honestly not sure what we were expecting. There isn't a lot of flavor to this, but there is table seasoning to fix that! It likewise wasn't terrible but we wouldn't get it again.  For the price, we weren't as satisfied or full as we hoped we would be. Okra was a standout, and maybe we'll come back to give the other skewers a try!"

        "Christine F.": "This is where you'll find high end Viet food in San Francisco. Gao Viet Kitchen is known for their phozilla and pho broth shots but there are other dishes to highlight here such as the BN B HU and PH TRN.  The BBH broth is spicy, just like the way I want it! The lemongrass doesn't overpower the dish but it adds that extra oomf to the soup. The dish also came with veggies like thai basil, bean sprouts, and lime. The limes weren't juicy so that made me sad. BUTTT I was never offered shrimp paste for BBH so I thought that was pretty unique. For the meats, there were cha lua, pork hock, pork ham, and butter brisket. Oddly, I didn't get pork blood with ours even though the online menu advertised for it. I'm actually not a big pork hock fan so I offered it to my friend.  The PH TRN was actually my least favorite. I never had this type of dish and wanted to try it. It comes with nuoc cham and the pho broth with bone marrow bites. I'm actually not a big fan of bone marrow but this soup made it very tolerable. Even though it's instructed to pour the nuoc cham in the dish, I personally didn't like it but it's possible that I could have poured too much in there. The beef was tender and the noodles they serve for this is actually the thicker ones-- like the ones they'd use for Northern style pho. I was surprised by how long the soup stayed hot throughout my dining experience.  Service wise, it was fine. Everyone checked up on my table which was nice. Only thing I kind of got confused was the response I received when I requested for a different plate because I saw some weird stuff on there. The male server was about to not give me another plate and said \"actually it's .. never mind I'll just get you another plate\". So I was kind of confused, but I still got my plate at the end.  I would definitely compare this spot to another establishment in SoCal. Unfortunately, I'd have to give this place a 3/5 due to that encounter with my server and how I didn't receive pork blood in my BBH even though it's advertised on the website menu. I would like to give it more, but I hope my review can be used as feedback for the establishment."

Also came with some veggies and banh hoi Pork belly - was a bit boring compared to everything else Beef carpaccio - was delicious. Not the best I've had but solid  Chubby Pho - def one of the top bowls of pho I've had. The broth was perfect and so flavorful with the globules from the marrow floating around. The beef was tender.

We ordered the lemongrass fried tofu, banh khot, banh cuon, five spice chicken with garlic noodles, and the big gao pho. The food came out quickly and all at once too, we barely had any room on our table to fit everything. I like that this place offers drinks, so it has the modern flare to Vietnamese cuisine.  I definitely would recommend this place to anyone who is craving Vietnamese food. The service was amazing and I don't think you can go wrong with anything that you order.

I ordered the Chubby Noodle, Vermicelli bowl and the imperial roll appetizer. We all also got the thai tea with pandan jelly. Prices are pricy!! But serving for the main course dishes are big. Appetizer serving was small. $8 for average thai tea. Pho was really good! Rice noodles were perfect and the broth had a lot of umami, would not rec bringing home if you don't finish since it gets mushy.  Overall would come again to try other stuff on the menu."

        "Doug W.": "I wish I could give this place more stars but I really do believe there's way better Vietnamese restaurants in SF- moreso the Bay Area. IMO, IG food bloggers overhyped this place so maybe I had higher expectations than I should have coming into our dinner.  Also just want to mention that Yelp waitlist quoted us ~25 mins but we ended up waiting about an hour and fifteen mins for our table. My review could possibly be skewed due to being seated around 8:45P so our food was probably at the bottom of the barrel maybe? We started off with alcoholic cocktails: the Holy Gao and the Passion Pisco- 4/5, both were really good and unique. I've never had a cocktail with a jalapeno in it so that was def new for me. The Holy Gao was def a stronger drink, the Passion Pisco was more on the sweeter side. Bo Tai Chanh- 3/5 this was just ok, it didn't have as much of that tangy lemony flavor as places like Bodega SF or Yummy Yummy. The quality of the meat was good though, but I just felt like it lacked flavor. They definitely gave a lot of onions (see pics) but overall I kinda wish we went with another appetizer. Something was just either lacking or the taste wasn't quite right. Big Gao Pho (added extra brisket)- 3/5 it was just too oily for us. We had to wipe our mouths every time we took a bite or drank the soup. I guess I should've expected that but I would've much rather gotten a #1 from Kevin's- maybe I just don't like having so much oil in my pho broths lol. I also felt like the soup wasn't simmered long enough or had enough beef bones because it didn't have as much of a beef flavor considering all the meat that was in the bowl. Their spices were more on the light side as well. Beef rib was good though (pretty tender and easy to cut through) and they do serve a generous amount of meat. Soft Shell Crab Bun Rieu (added an extra soft shell crab)- 3/5 of the 3 dishes we got, I liked this the least and usually I love bun rieu! Lack of that rich pork flavor in the soup, not much of a seafood/shrimp taste, and overall just on the bland side. I really just don't have much to say about it because it was that mediocre to me. If you're looking for good bun rieu, check out Kim Son in the Richmond.  Place definitely has a more modern vibe and clean feel, but at the price points of the bowls I honestly think they're just good for the gram- we paid $160 for 2 drinks, an appetizer, and 2 bowls of pho. Service was great though, I don't remember our server's name but he was really attentive and recommended the drinks to us with pretty accurate expectations. I'd probably come back with a larger group to try more items but I wouldn't get any of these dishes again."

        "Edward W.": "A recent dinner at Gao Viet proved to be a delightful culinary adventure. After adding ourselves to the Yelp waitlist, we were pleased to find that the wait time was minimal. Gao Viet sets itself apart from other Vietnamese establishments by offering a variety of unique dishes not commonly found in similar restaurants. Our chosen dishes for the evening included: Nem Nuong Roll: Grilled Pork Sausage Roll with fresh vegetables, herbs, rice paper, and house peanut sauce. A first-time experience for me, and it was truly enjoyable and expertly prepared. Bnh Bo: Savory Steamed Rice Cake with Shrimp Flake, Fried Shallot, and Green Onion. Another first-time dish for me, it proved to be a delightful and flavorful bite. Bun Bo Hue: Spicy Lemongrass Noodle Soup with Pork Hock, Pork Ham, Butter Brisket, Pork Blood Cube, Rau Ram & Onion, served with a side of cabbage/herb. This soup boasted a variety of meats and an incredibly delicious broth, leaving me no choice but to finish every last drop. Gao Viet offers a dining experience that showcases lesser-known Vietnamese dishes, making it a must-try for those looking to expand their culinary horizons. With its friendly service, cozy atmosphere, and fantastic food, Gao Viet is a restaurant that you'll undoubtedly want to visit again."

Marrow cracker - I never had anything like this before but it was definitely delicious.  Bo Tai Chanh - We love a good beef carpaccio. Hands down delicious and perfect to share. Big Gao Pho - Flavorful with fall off the bone meat. Bo Ne - This dish took awhile to come that the server thought we were done with our meal and put down the check on our table. Once this dish arrived, the server apologized. We found ourselves finishing the bread in an instant and all the delicious goodness that goes with it. Overall, everything was delicious and we will be back."

We waited for about 40mins, which was no problem since this place is so popular. Our server was friendly and very prompt with taking our order and ensuring we were okay. We started off with an appetizer, we ordered the wrap and roll. we were able to make our own rolls with various meats and veggies.  I opted for the big gao pho which was so much food for 1 person. It was really delicious and the meat was so tender where it was falling off the bone. My friends ordered the phozilla and shared it between 2 people and it was still a lot of food. We all had leftovers. It was great meal and I recommend trying at least once"

        "Regina W.": "The Castro is not really a destination for the best food in San Francisco, but since this was the area that I was spending time in I decided to look up where to get food that was also vegan friendly.  Tanglad had great Yelp reviews and is also centrally located in a fun part of The Castro. There were three clearly labeled vegetarian options on the menu: Vegetarian Spring Rolls (vegan), Vegetarian Noodle Soup (vegan) and Vegetarian Sandwich (vegan if you request no mayo). I decided to get the Vegetarian Spring Rolls to eat at the restaurant and the Vegetarian Sandwich (requested vegan) to eat later in the day.  The Vegetarian Spring Rolls were good, but not great and there were a few things about them I would have preferred differently. First of all there were hot mushrooms in them and while I would have preferred those in another dish, I like the contents of my fresh rolls to be completely cold. They were also cut up into pieces which made them harder to eat and I would have preferred for it be served whole and that way I can dunk it into the sauce myself.  The Vegetarian Sandwich came on bread that was slightly stale and dry and the bread could have definitely been more fresh. The contents of the sandwich besides the bread was pretty good, but it would have been nice to have vegan mayonnaise available for the sandwich. One of the best parts of my experience here was the outdoor dining with a covered roof were you could look out onto the street. I could see myself coming back here for that alone and trying the Vegetarian Noodle Soup if I came back."

I visited Tanglad with a friend while strolling through the Castro. It was a cold fall day and the thought of some hot soup was like a warm cozy blanket. We were seated immediately and the staff was incredibly friendly and efficient. I've been sticking to my vegan diet this year so I asked the server what vegan options there were, and the response was a bit confusing, but it seemed like the vegetable soup was the only option?  Regardless, the soup is what I ordered! The bowl was big and came out steaming hot! There were a bunch of fresh veggies and a couple pieces of tofu, unfortunately the broth itself tasted like nothing. I guess I was thinking it was going to be a veggie pho with all the aromatics (ginger, onion, cinnamon, cardamom, coriander, star anise) and maybe some vegan fish sauce. Instead it was more like they took some unsalted veggie stock and added some French's crispy fried onions. Also, the plate of bean spouts and basil was tiny and sad--one little wilted pieced of Thai basil. There was no amount of hoisin or sriracha that could save this bowl of \"soup\".  TLDR: If you are vegan you should probably try to find another place to grab some food!"

        "D L.": "As a Korean born/raised in SF, I'm always down to try an unventured Korean eatery. Came in around 8pm and was looking forward to trying the food. I scanned through the menu and noticed that the prices were a bit steep, but I was hopeful that it just meant the food was well worth it. Plus, who could turn down a place that's dedicated to their (um ma - mommy)? I decided to go a bit over budget and ordered the Surlangtang ($19) and Pork Belly ($27). Traditionally, the pork belly should be eaten as a lettuce wrap -- Korean lettuce, perilla leaves, sliced hot peppers, etc. I asked the server is this came with the pork belly. The server said it would cost an additional $5. I asked if it was because it came with a variety of greens, peppers, etc... nope... just lettuce. WTF! $5... for a few pieces of lettuce?!?! They were closing at 9pm, so I just ordered it and told myself that it would be worth it. Well, it wasn't because I didn't even get a chance to eat. In fact, 5 minutes later, the server comes back with one small plate of panchan. Not several small panchan dishes, like it should be and is shown in their Yelp photos -- it was just one small-ass, coffee cup saucer size plate of kimchi, two pieces of broccoli and four quail eggs. It looked like something you'd prepare for yourself at home with left overs. That's how bad it was. Now remember: I just ordered $50 worth of food and should have received, at least, 3-5 small white plates of panchan. When I saw this, I looked up at the kitchen and saw the staff just staring at me with this look, as if they knew what they had done was f'ed up. TBH, I think they just didn't want to do dishes since it was 45 minutes to closing time. I hailed the server and asked, \"Is this serious what you're giving me as panchan?\" She stared and me with a pause, and then replied, \"yes\". I got up and walked out. I should have taken a pic and posted it on Yelp, so you could all see it. It was bad.  Came home and noticed the newer reviews. Based on the poor reviews, seems that the terrible service only saved me from wasting my $50 on poor quality Korean food. I hope the owner reads this and does something about this because this place isn't going to last much longer. It's also putting shame to ."

The food? Not so much.  Gave <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fum.ma&s=03d4a029156c21c7cade414693cf64187d73e82aacc72b2027fb5fe451dd5b97\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">um.ma</a> a second shot and sadly, it was disappointing so gotta drop it to 3 stars.  Even tho the Korean food scene in SF has improved in the last couple of years, I still find myself regularly trekking to Santa Clara for Korean food.  First things first, make rezzies! On a Thursday night, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fum.ma&s=03d4a029156c21c7cade414693cf64187d73e82aacc72b2027fb5fe451dd5b97\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">um.ma</a> was hella poppin'!  The Complimentary Banchan: Kimchi, broccoli, yellow pickled radish, and quail eggs are aight. TBH, tasted like the ones from the Korean grocery store.  The $18 Soondubu-jjigae... the ratio of tofu + enoki mushrooms to broth were really off. Felt like 70% tofu/veggies to broth: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F4snh4ewe&s=0fb9f3ca863e4ebb7a44db5b6667fe1b085e5ce1813ed920cdc71875e254ec09\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/4snh4ewe</a>. Bummer when you want something soulful to sip on a wintry night. The $13 Ginger Soy Sesame KFC (6 pc) was hella salty and tasted more like gochujang: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F3dwa6u5f&s=ca1a493ef54c73fcd50cfc4cc5cf6b7d0cba50e1d97d71c91c99e88be844a780\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/3dwa6u5f</a>. IMO, for the best KFC in the city, hit up ILCHA.  The $18 Cheese Corn Bone Marrow was like a risotto (where's the cheese pulls?) and had a sour aftertaste: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F34csabt7&s=9132c9b6b94a2e3f2e5227f24d96b8f5e22f43a1ff5862126a2bb34e69ee7d7b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/34csabt7</a>. Redeeming the underwhelming cheese corn was the roasted bone marrow with umami-rich beef butter.  The $40 LA Kalbi is rich and tender with a savory sweetness and fatty caramelized edges: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fyf4yh35b&s=e44bd1b22676674a5da8151dfbdc0b6979d3f6fb73eb76214bf7ce57876936e0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/yf4yh35b</a>. Steep pricing at $40 for three slices of LA cut kalbi but that's the city for you.  As for service, they're severely understaffed with only one server and food runner for the patio and one server in the indoor dining area. The FOH are doing the best they can, just be aware that things may take longer than they should (took 20+ minutes to close the bill) and you'll have to wave someone down if you need something. Maybe time to consider implementing contactless ordering via toast? Overall, I get why <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fum.ma&s=03d4a029156c21c7cade414693cf64187d73e82aacc72b2027fb5fe451dd5b97\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">um.ma</a> is always poppin' but it's more of a place I would bring someone/peeps new to Korean food and/or for a hip Korean-American resto with an awesome patio."

We also got the kimchi prawns and seafood pancakes. Both were our favorite and a must to order when you go.  The jap chae was flavorful but it was quite liquidy. I don't think I'd order it again. I was also expecting more Korean side dishes, they only came out 4 little side dishes and typically Korean restaurants come out with 6 or more.

In addition to fresh, flavorful veggies, the dish came with purple rice -- which was a welcomed surprise! The seafood pancake was a unique fusion, with a Korean base and Japanese accents.  The mackerel was also well prepared, with a nice crispy char to the outer skin while remaining juicy and soft on the inside.

Yuza blonde: love a yuzu blended beer Pilsner: on the menu it says draft $8, but our bill said $12... Waiter later told me the can is $8, draft is $12, well why does the menu not differentiate between can and draft? You are lead to think there is only draft for $8! Chicken wings: good, nothing crazy, but the best thing out of the meal. Citrus gochujang wasn't too spicy! Kimchi fried rice: meat is an additional $4, but the menu doesn't list a price so it seems like it's included. So it's braised kimchi, rice, egg, and green onion - 4 ingredients for $16? Not worth it. Bibimbap - same issue with the menu, thought meat was included in the price. This came out so hot, absolutely steaming, that it wasn't edible for about 10 minutes. The rice completely burnt around the edges of the stone :( and the flavors blended together into mush since it was so hot... All in all, no bueno Before we left I told the waiter about the confusion in the menu (draft beer price +$4, meat additonal +$4 for both entree) and she said, \"Sorry, do you want a refund?\" each time. Perhaps this is me just me, but I expect proactivity from a Michelin rated restaurant - \"I'm sorry, let me refund you, I can see why that's confusing.\" Instead it makes me feel like a complaining customer.

This place takes reservations as it does get fairly packed, but if you're lucky, you might just get a seat or table.  We came during lunch, and we ended up sitting in the patio which was really nice, but sooooo cold! But luckily there were heaters everywhere so sitting out there was bearable. It's located in the Sunset and if y'all know it's a horror to find parking in. UmMa is like a really nice modernized korean restaurant and it's a great place to come to enjoy some good comforting meals.  Our table ordered a couple of things, but we got the chicken wings with all 3 flavors: Citrus Gochujang, Honey Butter, and Ginger Soy. All were really good! But my favorite was the Citrus Gochujang. I love saucier wings and this hit the spot.  To go with our starter, we got the Soondubu-jjigae, kimchi fried rice, pork bibimbap, tteokbokki and the seolleongtang. My favorite was the kimchi fried rice! First, I loved that they used purple rice. So unique and the whole dish itself was so smooth and buttery with lots of good flavor stemming from the beef. The pork bibimbap visually was beautiful but I thought the cuts of veggies were a little too large and I felt like there wasn't enough rice to accompany all the toppings on it. Everything else was good too but I thought the tteokbokki was a miss for me. I thought the sauce didn't really do it for me, and the rice cakes were a little too dry as well. My friends and I all agreed too. But the kimchi fried rice is a must have! Overall, this was a great place to come to. I would definitely still come back and it's a great place to go with friends as well. Also, this is my last post of 2022 so cheers to more food and reviews in the future!!!"

Dumpling Kitchen's warmth, light, and happy ambiance lured us in and we were quickly seated and served.  We ordered two items: the Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Dumplings (A01) and Wontons in Chili Oil (A13). The pork dumplings (AKA xiao long bao) were delightful: an incredibly flavorful, broth-filled, hearty experience. I would get them again in a heartbeat. The wontons in chili oil were amazing as well, and a good level of spice, though we wished that the filling inside had as much flavor as the xiao long bao. But accompanying them with the ginger dipping sauce or the soy sauce was more than enough to fulfill our flavor quota.  I've got to come back to try the rest of the menu!!"

Last time we were there, they shared their Castro location was struggling so that's where we headed on a Saturday night.  The food was delicious, as good as their original location except they only serve (6) XLB instead of 10 in an order. Our server mumbled that they didn't have the larger steam basket but with a wink and a smile I told them I was pretty sure they could find some. They forgot the dipping sauce with fresh ginger; I should've asked. We grazed around the menu, ordered standard Cantonese fare: Walnut prawns, Mongolian beef, Fried Tofu and Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings. Every plate was delicious and we took some things to go including a too-large sake. With every seat taken inside the restaurant, we were seated on the patio with its rustic wood and heat lamps to keep off the chill. Within a few minutes even the patio was mostly filled. If you're on a date or dining alone while reading, this is a more agreeable spot to be rather than an overlit dining room. We had an attentive waiter, food came to our table quickly but I was surprised when they told us the kitchen was closing soon (the restaurant closes early, at 9:30pm). If you don't feel like driving across town, this central location is easy to get to and has more street parking (yes, even in the Castro). I think they still have the best XLBs in the City!"

My favorite items were definitely the wontons in chili oil, bbq pork bao, and pork belly! The pork belly was so tender and melts in your mouth. As far as parking goes, there's street parking in the area but you may have to walk a little bit to find a good space. Don't forget, don't leave valuables in your car!"

        "Adam B.": "A perfect place to go with a group of 4 people, so you can maximize the dishes you get to try. With a name like Dumpling Kitchen, of course the dumplings are excellent. But there are also some great meat dishes and noodle dishes, so don't be totally dumpling-centric. Shanghai-style Steamed Pork Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao): It's pretty much obligatory that I order these whenever a restaurant has them. That first bite and slurp of soup (i.e. fatty goodness) is so perfect. After all the juice is sucked out though, it's kinda like a regular pork dumpling. Still delicious. Shanghai-style Pan-fried Pork Buns: Seemed very popular here. Thick dough where one side is nicely browned crispy and the other side is steamed like a dumpling. Great texture contrast. Pretty big size and filling. The pork inside is nice too. Boiled Chicken & Corn Dumplings: Kinda bland. Needed a good amount of chili oil from the table to liven it up. Beijing-style Noodle in Black Bean Sauce: Lots of umami goodness in this rich meaty black bean sauce. Also, the noodles are nice and springy. Definitely a fan favorite at the table. Braised Lion's Head Meatballs: Huge balls! Nice mix of minced meat and fat. Lots of rich sauce, so be sure to spoon some extra on what you're eating. Braised Pork Belly with Preserved Vegetables: Perhaps my favorite non-dumpling dish. The pork belly was super tender so the fat was almost melting in your mouth while the meat was easy to shred. What really struck me was how well the fat in the pork belly soaked up the flavorful sauce and spices. Pea Sprouts with Garlic: Why is this veggie dish priced the same as the pork belly? Totally not worth it. It's jut some plain greens with a little garlic. Note that the rich meatballs and pork belly come with some bright greens anyway."

        "Joe R.": "Fantastic food, the hot and sour soup is amazingly delicious. Added with a little heat, the dumplings are all super juicy. The knockout surprise performance was with the fish and chive dumpling. So smooth and delicate yet accidentally executed and delicious. The truffle fried rice, another surprise, knockout, unexpected and delicious highly recommend. All the dishes, my friends ordered they enjoyed thoroughly on top of the hot and sour soup which my friends keep coming back to time and time again. The lovely atmosphere that's relaxed and humorous at times is what it is relaxed no nonsense, excellent service with a little bell on your table to order more food. Quick and efficient worth the way, can accommodate large groups. This has become a favorite of the neighborhood and the new favorite in my heart. I"

        "Amy S.": "So glad to have another solid Chinese restaurant in Castro! We went for the soft opening and felt like they were still figuring things out, but excited to see how they improve with more time. FOOD Beef Shank & Tripe in Chili Oil - This one is a Chinese classic that I order as a baseline at most restaurants I go to. It was really well-seasoned, albeit a little too salty. The pieces of beef shank were super thick cut, whereas I feel like this dish is usually thin, deli-slice style beef pieces. Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Buns - The xiaolongbao here were pretty reasonable! The wrapper was not as chewy as I usually prefer, which also meant it tore super easily when it stuck to the steamer. At this price point though this is a solid place for XLB. Shanghai-Style Pan Fried Pork Buns - This is one of my favorite Shanghainese foods, so I order it whenever I get the chance. I really enjoyed their version of it, though it had a slightly stronger deep fried oil taste on the bottom than I'm used to. Pea Sprouts w/ Garlic - Solid stir fry!  Will definitely be back if I'm craving Shanghainese food."

        "Victoria F.": "A small storefront tucked in the heart of the Castro surprises you instantly if you walk in and ask to be seated in the back patio. We went midday on a Sunday and saw that this place had just had its grand opening! Din Sum gets all the love in San Francisco, it's about time to see another Shanghainese place pop up.  We ordered the classics, the pork XLB and the pan fried pork bun, both had incredible flavor and were so juicy. While the flavors were spot on, the XLB didn't have the smooth looking skin you'd expect and the pan fried buns had a bit of a thick bottom.  The dan dan noodles were delicious and had a perfect texture, but the chili oil wontons left much to be desired. They were really mild in flavor and had a very thick wonton skin.  Overall this place had such a home-y feel and mostly nailed all the nostalgic flavors from my childhood, but there are some imperfections with the skins for the buns, wontons, and XLB. They're just starting out and I'd be interested to check out how they improved in the near future!"

        "Ed U.": "544 Castro used to be the home of one of my favorite Castro eateries, Nirvana, where the casually exotic vibe was a nice match for their fusion fare. Then it became a splashy cantina, Papi Rico, and I thought it would stick around for a while. But it didn't probably because it couldn't gain traction due to the pandemic. Now it's become what I believe is the third location of Dumpling Kitchen. They started with their popular spot on Taraval, and they recently opened a spot off the Cal campus in Berkeley. In fact, I just tried that one for takeout last week. That's why I was surprised to see them at this prime location where they kept Papi Rico's fluorescent aquamarine facade. Inside it looks like a sleekly contemporary version of their familiar operation. Of course their menu featured a long list of dim sum selections, but there were other dishes as well...noodles, soups, mushu, chef's specials, even steamed chocolate baos. But I was in a dumpling mood, so I ordered two of their specialties. First up were the $9.80 Boiled Chicken and Corn Dumplings, eight little tightly tucked pillows filled with minced chicken and corn kernels (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3RBRfe5&s=68797b98ea792a7061e2edd304ce0fc60f5de5c78afd45cfab94947f75035120\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3RBRfe5</a>). The red chili oil enhanced the slightly bland flavor. The second dish was the clincher, the $10.80 Steamed Shrimp and Pork Shumai. There were only four of them, but each were meaty and hearty (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3B4roVi&s=be1c9609340c7835f613e1f533df122d2073c0ebe6b1e76a22b4c7155a818b1e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3B4roVi</a>). I definitely want to try those steamed chocolate baos sometime. I hope Dumpling Kitchen lasts longer than Papi Rico. FOOD - 4 stars...solid dumplings, some tastier than others AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...spacious enough though I miss the serene Nirvana vibe SERVICE - 4 stars...enthusiastic, still in the honeymoon phase TOTAL - 4 stars...dumplings in the Castro, a new era begins RELATED - Exploring the Castro?

Oh yea, and he's Chinese.  *FACE PALM* So happy to see one of The Sunset/Parkside's local favs open in The Castro because IMO, the Chinese restaurants in this area can be underwhelming/Americanized.

        "Thomas D.": "The food was so good--yum! I am keeping my fingers crossed that Dumpling Kitchen stays in this space that has been so many things before it: Nirvana, Papi Rico, and more! Four stars for the food and hospitality! We sat out back because the rest of the restaurant was reserved. This was good to note because next time we'll make a reservation. It was packed. I wouldn't say I liked sitting out back--it needs to be worked on a bit. It felt isolated and a bit dirty. You can think of the restaurant being divided into three separate spaces: the inside [as soon as you walk in there is also a small bar area], the middle section which is a large enclosed room, and then the backyard area. The restrooms were interesting. There are two of them, but one just has three urinals. They are so close together that you'll bump elbows with someone. They could use some TLC. The entire restaurant could too. It needs to be picked up and cleaned up a bit. The stairs to the backyard are sketchy, for example. Service was so nice but they were slow! Dishes came out at odd times and the condiments for the pot stickers were not brought until we asked for them. We ate them before the soy sauce, vinegar and hot oil arrived! Yep--they were delicious. Kind of doughy though. Loved the assorted chow mein, shrimp dumplings, and chicken and broccoli. Good food. Nice people. Lots of options. Make a reservation!"

The restaurant is located in the Castro district, parking can be little rough if you drive there. But I wouldn't let that discourage you from going to this place! The ambiance was really cute and I adorned it! It was fancy but yet casual at the same time. The had all types of historical photos of San Francisco posted on the walls. We walked in and sat down right away even with only half our party there. Our wonderful (wish I caught his name) server came over soon after and took our drink orders.  Soon we ordered and we had the Butcher's Potatoes, Feta Garides, Burrata Ravioli, 16oz prime ribeye and the truffle mac n cheese.  There is no words to explain how amazing and delicious each of the items were!! Just simply well seasoned, wonderfully cooked, and worth the wait.  For dessert, I was given the Opera cake I believe, each bite tasted like a ferrero chocolate! We also had the tiramisu and that was also delicious!  The staff, especially our server, were great and friendly. The atmosphere is also amazing! When they had brought out the cake with a candle for me, everyone had stopped from and sang along with my friends. it was a wonderful moment!  I definitely didn't leave disappointed and can't wait to return for another amazing meal. Thanks for making it a wonder birthday dinner for me!"

        "Kehaulani K.": "While I loved how cozy and romantic this spot was, I wasn't exactly fond of feeling like I was being pushed out of the restaurant the whole two hours I was there. Came here this evening with my friend. We ordered the octopus-in my opinion it was way too chewy for my liking. The lamb pops were cooked to perfection, but 22$ for 2 is a bit steep when you can buy a whole rack for that price. The short ribs were bone in and fall off the bone tender. This was probably my most favorite dish of the night and a decent size for the price point. Definitely would get again. The old fashioned was spot on and the wine prices weren't too bad either. I would of given this place four stars but I felt like we were being pushed out and rushed through the entire meal which isn't the vibe you want to be feeling when you're paying for dinner. Probably won't return, but glad I at least gave it a try."

I wanted to love this restraint so much but unfortunately our dining experience was just okay. First, our waiter changed twice so we're confused on who was going to be taking care of us. We ordered some sparkling rose and champagne but when the server delivered the drinks they were confused as to which drink was which. They even had to go back and check to make sure. To their defense the restaurant is very dim.  The food was fine but nothing exceptional. We started with the burrata (w/ prosciutto) and Brussel sprouts. We shared the ravioli, spaghetti and meatballs, fillet mignon, and salad. All dishes were ok. The fillet was very rare and when we checked with the server they said that is considered \"medium\" to them. We didn't want to be those people, so we just ate what we wanted and left a good portion of the steak on the plate. Probably won't be returning anytime soon."

The salads were quite generous. We probably could have shared one. I'm usually not a fan of sweet salads but this one was tasty indeed. The arugula was very fresh and the fruit was tasty. The octopus was prepared perfectly and hubby loved the nice tomato sauce. The lamb was fabulous. It was a bit crisp on the outside and perfectly tender and juicy on the inside. It benefited from salt which I easily added.  I do feel the prices here are a bit high but overall we did enjoy our meal very much!"

        "Sam W.": "[TLDR: Generous portions, delicious and diverse food choices, extensive wine and beer list, no cocktail menu (coming soon), friendly and speedy staff.] Dining at Blind Butcher with a group made my first visit here so much more enjoyable because I got to try more than just one dish! After being ushered to our table in the back, we started to order drinks when we were told there wasn't a cocktail menu (our waitress said it should be finalized in Jan/Feb 2023) but offered to make us almost any mixed drink. In their defense, the venue had only re-opened a few months prior, so it wasn't a big deal to craft one myself. I started off with a dirty gin martini and quickly switched to a glass of Malbec once my entree arrived.  When you talk about meat falling off the bone, their braised short ribs are the prime example. So tender, flavorful, and scrumptious! I was a bit confused by the sauce, which the menu labeled as a \"wine jus reduction\", but the meat seemed to be doused in a tomato pasta sauce. By no means is this a complaint, because the meat, sauce, and potatoes were incredibly delicious. The rest of our table opted for the burger, grilled pork chops, Roka salad, and we all split the calamari to start. Our waitress brought over a bowl of salted caramel gelato for the birthday boy, complete with a candle on top! Prices were a bit steeper than I expected, but honestly worth it for the very generous portions you receive. Looking forward to coming back and seeing what cocktails the mixologists have been working on!"

We got the wagyu sliders and the Roka salad to start. It was my first time having wagyu and i definitely understand the hype now, SO good. They add caramelized onions as well, and it just elevated the burger just enough to reach peak flavor.  I highly recommend the Roka salad- the bits of apple and dried fig in combination with the arugula and goat cheese was perfectly sweet and savory. It ticked all the boxes for me.  The prime ribeye was presented beautifully and the roasted onion, Shishito peppers, and tomato were a welcomed addition to our slab of meat. Thank god for the mound of flakey salt they provide, because the meat definitely needed an extra oomph. It was good, but now that i've tried it, I probably wouldn't order again.  The mashed potatoes were decadent, perfectly creamy, but had to add a bit of that flakey salt to really bring it to flavortown.  They brought over a nice slice of cake for my partner's birthday and it was perfect.  Grateful for the healthy pours of wine and a full belly!"

Sadly we weren't offered one and were just given the bill when we finished. ----- [ menu ] ----- - Truffle french fries ($11): These were yummy! The truffle flavour really came through. - Octapodaki ($22): Mmm tender and had good flavour! The sauce was very tomato-ey, almost like marinara. - Buccattini wagyu meatball ($29): The noodles were a bit too firm for my taste but the meatballs had a lot of good flavours in it. I wouldn't pay $29 for this though. - Truffle lobster mac & cheese ($28): This! I would come back for this. So cheesy and it had lots of lobster bits! - Braised shortribs ($44): These were so good! So tender and the meat fell easily off the bone. Also came with mashed potatoes which was good. (I'm in shock how expensive this was though...) ---------- * Review based on 1st visit.

Kinda hidden, but you just need to walk the block of Steiner, and it's next door to Isa.  Happy Hour is from 4-6p and it is a solid deal. Your choice of 3 drinks for 15.00, where can you find that?? And appetizers were a deal as well.  Reservations are suggested. The joint itself gets super packed! Was shocked after 7p the line was out the door.  Anyhoot, amazing food down to flavors on point! Will definitely go back."

Our favorite was the miso pork and fried rice, so flavorful and well balanced. The jang cream pasta was a bit disappointing, just felt like a typical mushroom cream pasta.

        "Austin Y.": "Our server recommended Uni Scallop Toast, Kimchi Fried Rice, Galbi NY Strip, and Mulhwe Noodle. They indicated all Tapas are intended to be shared by 2 people. Uni Scallop Toast (8/10): The highlight of our dining experience. They used quality uni and scallop, and combined with other ingredients it created a unique flavor profile. However, I think the texture and bready-ness of the toast detracts from the flavors of the rest of the dish. I would have preferred rice or something softer and less rich. Korean Steak Tartare (8/10): Tartare marinated in a Korean style sauce. Tasted good, but the sauce was somewhat overpowering. Mulhwe Noodle (7/10): The seasonal fish they used tasted fantastic, with a clean flavor profile and melt-in-your-mouth texture. The noodles and the rest of the dish fell flat. The noodles felt like standard grocery store egg noodles and didn't absorb any of the chili-broth. It also didn't feel like the noodles and chili broth complimented the raw fish that well. Galbi NY Strip w/ Assorted Lettuce Wraps (6/10): I do not recommend adding the lettuce wraps. The NY strip was cooked nicely, but it was too lean and a bit chewy. A fattier cut of steak with some marbling would have tasted better and paired better with the lettuce wraps. The lettuce wraps themselves were beautifully presented with large, flawless leaves. But some of the stronger tasting leaves overpowered the flavor of the steak. Service (9/10): We were able to get a 9 pm reservation on the same day and were seated quickly. Servers were friendly and were very helpful in helping navigate the menu. Ambiance (9/10): Well decorated and lit. My only wish is that the middle dining tables were a bit more secluded."

        "Nick C.": "It's difficult to do high end, modern, asian food well.. especially Korean food. The foundations of the culture's cuisine often gets lost in the recreating or transformation of the dishes. However, Bansang exceeded all of my expectations and restored my faith in progressive takes on asian food. From the get go, the service was great. Our waiter was calm, respectful, and friendly. His etiquette reminded me of the servers in nice restaurants in Seoul. The interior was really pretty. Lots of natural light to show off the modern decor and seating.  Every dish was incredible. The menu is tapas style. The apps, small plates, and banchan were all so fresh and light in the best way. The larger plates that followed were just rich and heavy enough to satisfy our appetites. The plating was beautiful and the flavor of each dish really tasted like what we all expect a \"modern Korean\" dish should taste like. The chefs were able to maintain the integrity of Korean flavors but with an elevated elegance to them--you can tell they really put heart and thought into their food.  I will definitely be coming back here. One of my favorite higher end restaurants in the bay area."

        "Alli W.": "A solid 3.5 My boyfriend and I made a rezzie a week in advance and were seated immediately upon checking in on time. The interior was gorgeous. It was basically a huge studio with tall ceilings and big windows. And!! Open kitchen :) They also have a bar seating that was facing the open kitchen. Service: 10/10. Our waiter was really friendly and efficient. Ambiance: 9/10. Semi-casual dressed and loud diners + pop music. Dim lighting after sunset. It was a vibeeeee. Food: 6/10. Pricey for mediocre food. Uni scallop toast - It was a bit tart and sweet bc of seaweed pure and soy yolk. Uni and scallops were very fresh, buttery, and delicious. All the flavors worked so well together and each bite was literally bursting with SO many different flavors. However!! Toasted buttermilk bread was too thick tbh so it was very difficult for me to get everything in one bite. It was also too toasted. I personally thought price was fair (27$) although it was small bc it had generous amount of uni and scallops and was unique in presentation and taste. Steamed eggs with caviar - VERY small serving. The steamed egg itself was pretty bland but eating it together with caviar + potato crumbles saved the dish. I saw in other photos their steamed eggs had a lot more potato crumbs :(( Radish kimchi fried rice - SMALL serving. Had that burnt rice taste and smell. But there was very little kimchi so once the fried rice was mixed with the egg, it just tasted like regular burnt fried rice lol Jang cream pasta - SMALL serving. Mushrooms in this dish tasted delicious but pasta was kind of bland and oily. Gochujang black cod - Such a big letdown for a 29$ dish lol. The fish was really soft, buttery, and thick but 1) it was ridiculously bland and 2) tasted really fishy. Gochujang sauce saved the fish here by adding some sort of flavor to it but even then, the sauce tasted like toned-down sweet and sour sauce lol. Service: 10/10 Ambiance: 9/10 Food: 6/10"

        "Colleen M.": "Just had dinner here tonight with a friend and we ordered: - Sunchoke and truffle ($17) - uni scallop toast (x2) ($26 per) - lime soy fried chicken ($11) - hwe sam ($13) - mulhwe ($22) - galbi NY strip ($39) +$5 for lettuce Overall, we enjoyed it all. The standout of the night was the sunchoke and truffle, with so much great flavor and texture. The uni scallop toast was a little underwhelming - I would recommend splitting one between 2 people so you can try it, but it otherwise isn't the best uni toast I've had and a little difficult to eat. Hwe sam (yellowtail and white kimchi served with endives and shiso on the side) was a great snack. I could have done without the mulhwe (cold noodle dish with seafood), and the fried chicken was surprisingly very good! A great fried batter with a vaguely Thai taste from the lime. They must have improved on portion sizes because the galbi is now quite generous - it was more than enough for the two of us and was quite good. There wasn't quite enough fat on the NY strip, and it's a little odd to me that the lettuce is $5 more... but it is what it is. All in, a beautiful space for semi-formal dinner with solid service. Give it a try!"

        "Valerie G.": "Pass by this place all the time and was super excited to try it for my birthday dinner with my parents and boyfriend. Broccolini - 5/10 hard to chew, a little too much going on with all the flavors  Kimchi fried rice - 10/10 excellent taste and the poached egg was perfect  Gochujang tartare - 9/10 doesn't look like much at first but is really good and a great shareable Pork collar - 8/10 Really good and easy to share but some parts were not tender and was not enjoyable to chew  Cod - 10/10 delicious and the marinade it was on was very tasty!! Bean sprouts were charred to perfection! Definitely not the best Korean food I've had but also not the worst. Think it was overall average after having very high expectations. Great ambience for what it is and happy I was able to celebrate my birthday walking distance of my house on a horrible stormy day!"

        "Nicole T.": "I had a lovely time dining at Bansang. Even though it'd been a rainy gloomy day, the very kind and attentive waitstaff were enough to make it feel just a little bit brighter! I tried the Mulhwe, Uni Scallop Toast, and their Soy Milk Caneles. One order from the small tapas and one from the large tapas was filling enough for me, so I think the recommendation of 3 dishes per person is reasonable. Everything tasted really fresh and well-cared for! The Uni Scallop Toast is definitely a crowd favorite, and within good reason. The uni and scallops were so creamy and complimented well from the crunchiness of the toast; it was a pair that couldn't be beat. The mulhwe's fresh fish and surprisingly boldly-flavored chilled chili broth was very addicting to eat -- the noodles soaked up all the flavor wonderfully. Definitely was a fan of the canele as well! Overall, I'd totally come back to try other menu items!"

        "Janice J.": "We made a reservation for a group of four. The restaurant is really popular so highly recommend making a reservation. Bansang serves traditional Korean food tapas style. The interior was a little dim but had every elegant design. We got mulhwe, brussel sprouts, Hwe Ssam, soy lime fried chicken, sunchoke and truffle, jang cream pasta, Rice cake and chorizo. Our favorites were the mulhwe, soy lime fried chicken and sunchoke and truffle. The mulhwe was delicious - the broth was tangy and had so much depth. The chicken was a table favorite (I don't eat meat but everyone I was with does). The chicken was so crispy and the lime soy combo was unique. I also love sunchoke and the subtle flavor of shaved truffle. This was a lot of dishes and it starts to add up. Since there wasn't a lot of carbs, the dinner wasn't that filling. Don't expect to feel full after this meal without paying more than $50 per person."

        "Edward W.": "I recently visited Bansang, a place known for its modern take on Korean cuisine. I had always heard great things about this restaurant and was excited to give it a try. Here's a breakdown of the dishes we tried and my thoughts on each. Fried Chicken: The lime soy sauce, shishito peppers, cilantro, and omija radish pickles gave this dish a nice kick. It was tasty but not mind-blowing. Beef Tartare: An interesting combination of striploin, Korean pear, parmesan cheese, and tortilla chips. It was enjoyable but not necessarily a standout dish. Rice Cakes: The crispy rice cakes with Spanish chorizo, roasted gochujang, and cotija cheese were a creative twist on a Korean classic. Mulhwe: This dish had assorted seafood, fermented chili broth, seaweed oil, cucumber, and pickled mu. A nice, refreshing option. Bulgogi: The charcoal-grilled bulgogi with charred romaine, sesame dressing, and rice puff was well-executed, but didn't have any exceptional qualities. Short Rib: The prime beef short rib with pine nut sauce, seasonal soy-pickles, and persimmon kimchi was tender and flavorful. Agu: The combination of ankimo, monkfish, orange confit, mung bean sprouts, and chili fumet made for a unique and satisfying dish, definitely a lot of interesting flavors. Jang Cream Pasta: Rigatoni with maitake mushrooms, sugar snap peas, and mushroom cream offered a delightful fusion of Korean and Italian flavors. Bibim Noodles and Pork Jowl: The capellini, sesame leaves, fennel, cashews, and yuza gochujang sauce made for an enjoyable, but not groundbreaking, dish. Overall, I would say that I enjoyed most of the dishes at Bansang, but none really stood out as truly exceptional. The food was well-prepared and the fusion of different flavors was interesting, but nothing left me craving a return visit."

        "Linda H.": "This place has been receiving a lot of hype lately and was rated Michelin guide..so had to check it out. The sake Bellini was awesome, def recommend, not too sweet or strong. For apps went with the uni toast which was delicious, def do one per person if you can. Also went with the monk liver and quail egg... doesn't look that appetizing but it's amazing. The liver wasn't fishy at all and cooked and paired perfectly with the quail egg. Tried the Hwe see which was basically marinated yellowtail - Almost poke style that you wrap with endive. For main went with the galbi which came with two house made sauces and house salt options. The galbi was perfection on its own but the condiments did change up and intensify the flavors. Also tried the miso pork which again knocked it out of the park. The kale chips were perfection. Pork was cooked perfectly, tender, juicy and flavorful.  Overall, an incredible place. Would def go back and try the other items on the menu. Worth the hype!"

Can a place offer good American breakfasts and dim sum? After trying them, we both agreed that it is possible.  While I was eyeing the dim sum items on the menu, my husband zeroed in on the spicy pulled pork scramble and for good measure, we got the Jamie's Combo that pretty much has everything including pancakes. He liked almost everything but loved the pancakes! I ordered some dim sum: shrimp dumplings, pork sui mai, and pork ribs with black bean sauce. Everything tasted great. The shrimp dumplings skin is not too thick either.  Service and ambiance: very polite and pleasant. The owner thanked us for coming in and supporting their business."

The owner accidentally gave us someone's order of the same item, however could not find or find any confirmation of who ordered it. My bf joked if we could have it for free.

Prices are not bad by SF standards, about $15 per dish. My favorite was the Salmon Benedict with hash browns. Not sure why the sauce was pink, but it looked cool! Very soft and flavorful. The smoked salmon had a fresh savory taste that goes well with the warm bread and eggs. I was surprised the egg yolk wasn't runny, but still good.  The desserts were alright. The matcha french toast had little matcha taste to it and was kind of bland. The Mascarpone pancakes had egg white filling that gave an unexpected sponge texture. I did really like the sweet and salty cream at the top. As well as the fresh fruit and flowers on the side. Overall it's a solid brunch spot. Impressed by the range in their menu. Desserts were ok, but the savory foods were the best."

Marscapone Pancakes - delicious! I think they whip egg whites and pour it in the middle because the center of the pancakes were white and super fluffy. I really enjoyed this. It's perfectly sweet with banana, walnuts and marscapone cream. Didn't even need syrup.  Spicy Pork Benedict - good, and I loved the hashbrowns.  Bacon - shout out to them for having the crisp bacon!

        "Aria H.": "First of all, the food was very good. My friend got Oreo pancakes and I got the Joe's Special Scramble, and both were delicious. My eggs could have been a little bit more seasoned, but nothing that some salt and ketchup couldn't fix.  However, getting seated was a hassle. We walked in and were told that it would be a 5-10 minute wait, and we were fine with that, so we were waiting. He told us we could sit at the counter and wait, but there was something on it, so he said he would clean it first. But then we looked over and another party that came in after us was being seated at the counter. He apologised, and we said it was fine, that we would wait for a table.  And then this couple came in and was immediately seated at a table even though we had been waiting. The guy in charge saw that one of the waitresses had seated them before us, so he apologized and went other to ask them to give up their seats for us. The couple was really rude about it as if they hadn't seen us standing there waiting the entire time. They were seated pretty soon after us, but the waitress went and took their order before ours even though we were there first and seated first. After she took their order, she went and was doing stuff at the register without even looking in our direction for at least five minutes. Finally she decided to take our order after we tried to flag her down several times.  The whole experience was pretty frustrating, but it was also a lot of misunderstandings so I don't think it's entirely the restaurant's fault. I'm honestly more annoyed that the couple was complaining about it and being so rude when they were the ones who ended up getting their food first anyways.  The food was so good that it was sort of worth it, hence the four stars. Definitely would not be okay with it happening again, but I wouldn't be opposed to going back and hopefully receiving better service."

When we got here, we were probably one of only two tables in the space at an hour before closing. We figured this is normal...but then they started getting really busy, where every table was occupied. After getting our food, I could see why. The food is American breakfast style. A unique feature is a selection of dim sum dishes (har gao, siu mai, soup dumplings, etc) that they offer. I've never seen a western place do dim sum too, but it does seem like a great option to bring your immigrant parents while you load up on your western breakfast. Win-win! Staff was very friendly and came over with water and attention for the dog. It was great. The food was quite good and very Instagram-friendly. I got a seafood omelet with the most gigantic shrimp - pretty sure they could call these things prawns. The potatoes were nice and crisp and the portions perfect. I was a little ambitious and ordered a soup dumpling to try. They forgot it for a while, but when we asked they got it done right away, which was great! The dumpling tasted good, but probably needed a towel over the lid to capture the extra liquid - the base of the wrap had gotten soggy, so was harder to eat.  Despite the small sadness at the dumpling, I'd still give this place 5 stars. Great service and great food does that!"

We ordered the baby kale salad, the moto pizza, and the mushroom pizzas to share. For the price, I expected larger portions of each. The baby kale salad was good - it came with fresh radish, corn, and avocado. There were few toppings for both pizzas including cheese - the sauce was watery, so the cheese and toppings slid off. The bread itself was soggy and the crust was dry."

Under the arugula is a mix of sauted mushrooms, softened onions just beginning to caramelize , and melty cheese. The crust is thin and crispy, with lots of air bubbles which I love. Overall, it's a very decent pie but I wish the toppings went closer to the crust. It felt like each little slice was 1/3 crust and 2/3 pizza."

Lamb and pork meatballs with the pistachio yogurt and the garlic bread knots to start. Arancini was good but a close third.  The cavatelli with brisket is a must. As was the butternut sage baked rigatoni.  For the pizza, the Amatriciana with the Calabrian chilies pancetta and egg (break up the egg in the middle to mellow out the chilies for anyone who wants a little less heat) is unique but balanced, and the mushroom pizza with truffled pecorino and caramelized onions and a practical salad-worth of fresh arugula.  As for the desserts, in order of favorites... The lemon verbena panna cotta with black berries is to die for. The tiramisu and pot de creme are also very very good, but that panna cotta still haunts my dreams.  Also a big thanks to Tracy for her great service, humor, recommendations and discovering our party's misplaced purse and then pulling my cell from the yelp reservation!

We got this as take out as we were driving back from a day in Sonoma and in need for some carbs after all that wine. Takeout was pretty quick for a Saturday night taking about 20 minutes when we called. Service was good and answered any questions we had. Wood fired pizza's with all of their toppings tasting fresh Some thoughts on what we ordered: Marinated Broccoli Di Ciccio: chilies, preserved lemon, white anchovies & Pecorino Romano. My girlfriend loved this. The lemon and chillies were excellent over the broccoli. I am not a huge anchovies guy so I put that to the side but a very good appetizer.  Bianca Pizza: onion crema, shaved garlic, preserved lemon, provolone & wild arugula. Onion cream is the base sauce for this pizza. Very good if looking for something with no meat and a tad lighter. Loved the arugula on the pizza didn't overtake it to me.  Sweet Corn: provolone, onion crema, kale & creminelli pepperoni. I love how they put corn on pizza and this was no exception. Huge pepperoni's and not too much kale on the pie. Not a ton of sauce on it so you can taste the toppings. Ragazza changes their menu seasonally so if there is a pizza you like on the menu check it out before it changes!!"

        "Hina M.": "I had the pleasure of brunching at Kitchen story on a Saturday around 12 pm with a group of four people. This place has been on my husbands go to places since a very long time and I am so glad that our expectations were met here. The food and the service were totally on point.  We had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad for a Saturday. I ordered the California burger. My friends got the Millionaires Benedict, Big Hass and the Athenian Omelette. We also got the Strawberry Mimosa and the Matcha Latte. Our server made sure to check on us couple of times and the food came out relatively fast. All of us really enjoyed everything and were very satisfied with the meal. My husband enjoyed the Millionaires Benedict so much that he told me this is his new favourite brunch place in the city.  Both the Omelettes were delicious and the portion size was great. The California burger was delicious as well, specially the flavour of caramelised onions and avocado was a great addition. The potato wedges were so crispy and good, we couldn't stop eating them. Overall, we had a great experience at Kitchen story. Delicious food with very generous portions. We would definitely be back to try more stuff on their menu."

        "Vivian W.": "Came for a (rainy) weekday brunch around 11:30am. I made a reservation online just in case, but it wasn't needed. My friend was running late to meet me, but the staff was nice to let me sit down first so I started with a coffee. When she finally joined me, they wanted us to order quickly (which felt odd since they didn't really push me to order anything else while I waited for her)  I got the Athenian omelette and she got the ricotta hotcakes meal with millionaire's bacon. Portions here are huge! And they do not shy away from the butter. We both enjoyed our meal, but friend also commented that she would have been content with one piece of bacon (meal came with two) given the portion of the overall meal. I would come back again, but probably on weekdays only. I heard weekends get packed and the tables are pretty close together."

        "Sophie K.": "This place has high ratings for brunch, so we came on a Monday afternoon because my normal favorite spot was closed Mondays (Mama's on Washington Square).  TLDR: This may have replaced my favorite brunch spot. It's great.  FOOD: My boyfriend and I have been here twice. Our second time coming here we ordered the same thing as the first visit because it was so good! We got the pork belly rancheros and the mascarpone stuffed French toast. YUM. The combination of flavors in the pork belly rancheros it's truly delightful. Pork belly, tomato, arugula, soft egg, and avocado. Plus a side of potatoes. What's not to like? The mascarpone stuff French toast is truly decadent, but oh so good. It is fried and filled with sweet cheese, but the texture really hits the spot. Would recommend both. Our first visit we got the millionaires bacon, we had the sampler, which gives you a taste of all 4 bacon types. Overall, we enjoyed it but didn't order it or second time because we thought it was a bit over priced for what it was ($23 for 4 pieces of bacon) but we are glad we tried at the first time though because it was deli. DRINKS: We've tried the matcha mango drink and black soy sesame latte. Both were great.  SERVICE: Solid. People are nice, and it's quite quick.  AMBIANCE: Very cute. The outdoor patio is great when it's nice out, although the ground there is a bit crooked.  OVERALL: A+. New favorite spot. Highly recommend."

We ordered Mascarpone Stuffed Deep Fried French Toast, Millionaire's Benedict, and sesame latte. Everything was flavorful and bold. The fried French toast was rich and great to share. The millionaire bacon gave me jerky vibes. Sesame latte had hints of chai? Around 6o$ for everything. Great place for fancy brunch."

        "Jacqueline M.": "Hm. I have mixed feelings about Kitchen Story. I went with a group of friends on a weekend (Saturday brunch).  Nearby parking is limited. Expect to walk a bit from your car to the restaurant. After we put a name on the waitlist, we waited for roughly 20 minutes for a table. Given that we showed up around 10:30, I think this wait time isn't bad at all. The menu is extensive and expensive. I ended up ordering the Franciscan omelet to split with one friend, and I think we made the right choice to share. The omelet was fairly sized, but the toppings (or fillings?) made it a hefty meal. After eating that, a small scoop of potatoes, and a thick piece of bread, the two of us were full. I thought this omelet was flavorful and tasty, and I would recommend splitting it if you're here for breakfast/brunch. I also ordered an oat milk latte ($6), which I really liked. After living in the city for a couple years, I can't even bring myself to complain about the cost of espresso drinks. (Saint Frank, I see you.)  The infamous Millionaire's bacon was not too bad. I believe they have some kind of tasting dish with a few different types of bacon. It's a fun thing to split between a big group. Most of the bacon flavors were kind of polarizing. This was something to try once. I think you kind of pay extra to eat at a trendy/popular restaurant. The food and drinks are tasty, but $20+ for an omelet is pricey. The waitstaff were very kind and accommodating, but I felt bad that they seemed to be stretched a bit thin -- the restaurant was really packed for brunch. I'm unsure if I would go back."

        "Ashley H.": "2/25/2023 What a great way to start off our day in the city! Of course we had to start with some sustenance. My sister mentioned Kitchen Story. The waitlist was closed on yelp so I was already expecting a long wait. It's not super easy to find parking but after a couple times around the block we finally found a parking spot. When we walked to the restaurant and put our name on the list the wait time was only 17 minutes. Way better than I expected. There is a lot of seating which I think helps get people seated faster. We got seated inside...thank god! Everyone who sits outside are troopers. We were seated at a two seated table against the kitchen wall I ordered the Pacific Benedict which was amazing! I really liked the different kinds of potatoes. The potatoes were delicious!  My sister ordered the Egg Plate with Smoked Applewood Bacon. The eggs were super fluffy. After we were done eating we were both super content. Not overly full which was good because we had clothes to try on haha I would definitely come back again! Love having options in the city to go eat at."

        "Jennifer S.": "Obsessed. It's such a good brunch place. We came on Sunday around noon and the wait for 2 people was around 45 minutes. There are so many options to choose from to eat. We got the bacon flight, which was super filling and fun to try the different types. Our favorite was still the original bacon and also the citrus one! I've never had fried french toast but it was amazing. The belly rancheros were very rich and the portion was huge. We were seated outside and it was not a good experience. The roof was leaking onto our table and the table was extremely tilted which made it hard to eat. Any small movement would dramatically shake the table. Our waitress even spilled coffee and it rolled all the way down the table. I would come back but definitely get seated inside.  5/5 food, 4/5 service, 2/5 seating"

Drinks: Herbal Mocktail - light and refreshing, tart and lemon forward with a slightly herbaceous note Tropical Mocktail - sweet fruity with notes of passion fruit in a beautiful reddish pink from the hibiscus Food: French Toast Sticks - so good a must order for the table, these were crunchy, deep fried french toast sticks served with pumpkin butter, came with 4 pieces Waygu Beef Tartar - good, beef was tender with bits of parmesan and capers, served with crostini, seasoning was okay wish there was a bit more acid Summer Vegetable Hash - two poached eggs on top of a bed of more fall themed vegetables like potatoes and delicata squash with a bit of arugula and calabrian chili, interesting wish the vegetables had more of a crisp and char Sesame Flatbread - this is served with a smoked salmon mousse, flat bread was tasty and mousse was well seasoned and a nice whipped texture, think I would have preferred slices of smoked salmon but overall good Service was good, servers checked in regularly, water was refilled often no complaints. Overall more of a 3.5. Food was good but other than the French Toast Sticks nothing really blew us away. Decent brunch and love that you can make a reservation. Would consider coming back for happy hour."

The chef/owner seemed to be chatting it up with multiple tables (he didn't say anything to us but that's ok). For the food is was served promptly and the portions looked decent. But I felt the egg rolls were way too oily. It seemed that the heat wasn't high enough so the wrapper soaked up a lot oil. The pork had lots of fat on it. Even though it looked like a large portion it was mostly vermicelli and sprouts. It would have been nice to have another ounce or so of pork. Prices seem to be inline with similar places. They do give you a massive cup for tea!!"

The beef garlic noodle is the most flavorless garlic noodles we ever had ( you can even tell that from the picture). It's pretty hard to get garlic noodles that's not good and tasteless. Hainan chicken rice- below average. Imperial rolls- meat inside was pretty lean so it's pretty rough."

I should have gotten the message but maybe my bad for ordering in Cantonese but I asked for beef stew rice (faan) and received beef stew pho (fun). Didn't want to fuss so I ate it. The beef was not as tender this time. If I'm paying $50 for 2 bowls of noodles and a drink, the least they can do is get my order right. No plans to return anytime soon.

It's a fairly small mom-and-pop type of place, and I placed a phone order for to-go at around 6 PM on a Friday. The food was ready in about 30 minutes, and it was still hot by the time I got back to where I was staying (about a 10 minute drive away). The people who greeted me were very welcoming, and even with the busyness of the dinner rush, they were friendly and patient while I paid and received my food. I ordered the Korean seafood pancake and the dakdoritang. The seafood pancake came with a delicious soy sauce to dip into, and it paired very nicely with the pancakes (but the pancakes were delicious on their own too!). The dakdoritang was super juicy and had a nice kick to it. The portion sizes for both were generous, and I found myself struggling to eat it all (even though I was super hungry by the time I sat down to eat). The food was a little pricey, but not unlike most food in the area (from what I saw). Given the large portions, delicious food, and great customer service, I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the Bay Area!"

The bottom of the rice crisped up really nicely, adding some crunch to the meal. All my other friends got tofu soup lol. Seemed pretty good, but if you're looking for spice, I'd say get a level or two higher than normal. They said theirs wasn't that spicy.  I personally didn't try the seafood pancake, but it looks decent. I prefer the crispier style, but this style is sometimes nice too. It just looked okay."

We waited 30 min. Server took our order while we waited and recommended some dishes - smart move to save time. We started out with the soft tofu with chicken soup which was spicy even at medium, but good! The japchae was good although I've had lighter. By the time, the huge seafood pancake came, my friend had to awkwardly eat from his bowl above the pancake bc there was no room on our small table for two. A bottle of water was on the table for us to help ourselves to. Food was good, fresh and prices were reasonable. I've had better banchan (small dishes), but that would probably affect the price.

But I felt like it had too much MSG in the soup! I was really thirsty the whole day and had that parched throat feeling. Side dishes were pretty simple: kimchi, spicy oden, potato, broccoli, and bean sprouts. They didn't have hot water or the usual barley tea -- would love to see that to complete the experience!"

        "Emily Z.": "Manna NEVER fails to disappoint. It's a small mom and pop Korean spot in the inner sunset, and it's the perfect place for satisfying your Korean cravings! I used to frequent this place years ago in high school, but they have now changed and modernized the place and have added some outdoor seating as well. The consistency and quality of the place had stayed the same after all these years.  We came in around 3PM on a Saturday afternoon, and it was pretty crowded despite being off peak hours and had to wait about thirty minutes for our party of 3. They had plenty of tables to sit two people, so it might be tough to get seated if you're coming in a larger party.  I ordered the galbi tang, and we shared the seafood pancake appetizer. I also got to try a bit of the dae ji bul kogi, or the spicy marinated pork. The galbi tang was really well flavored and came out piping hot, perfect for a cold day. The seafood pancake was also really yummy! Although it wasn't crispy like how you'd find it at other places, it was really well flavored and had a nice chewy texture. The pork was also really delicious and had a nice sweet and spicy flavor. They also offer banchan of fish cakes, bean sprouts, shredded potatoes, kimchi, and broccoli; all were flavored well and tasted delicious.  Service here is really great, even though they're constantly moving around to help everyone. The staff is incredibly friendly and make you feel right at home. Food comes out relatively quickly, and portion are huge.  Parking can be a little bit tricky since it's the inner sunset, but definitely visit Manna to satisfy your cravings of a home cooked Korean meal!!"

You don't get the \"wow\" feeling of eating a real bite of house made banchan. But I did really appreciate the variety they offered!  We ordered two pretty standard entrees, the spicy tofu soup and bibimbap (not the stone pot one). The tofu soup had good flavor, but was pretty watery. It comes out boiling hot, so def perfect for a chilly sf day/night. The bibimbap was pretty underwhelming. The rice was slightly mushy and the toppings didn't have too much flavor, so I had to add a bunch of sauce to spicy it up.  I'm glad I got to try this place, but it's not anything out of the ordinary."

Highly recommend.  Their spicy seafood soup had the same seafood from the seafood pancake along with blue crab and mussels on a shell. It was quite spicy.  Their spicy chicken stew had some nice flavor but it gets a bit sweet if you keep eating it.  Their sweet and spicy chicken wings were super tangy, sweet, and spicy. The flavor was pretty good but gets quite tangy if you keep eating."

You get a salad with a nice vinaigrette, a small amount of fried plantains, some rice, a side of beans, and the star of the plate in my opinion, the big ball goodness. The waiter passes out hot sauce for those wishing to ingest it with your food. Sweet ice tea was alright.  The decor is very nice. The photos and symbols of the island are very dominant and add a lot of character to the vibe. There's an exterior patio for service but in the early morning it wasn't put into much use. Service was okay. Took a while for the order to come without warning. The staff member was nice to serve me and refill my water. Water is complimentary.  It's adorable and savoury.

Mofongo is traditional in Puerto Rico and one of Parada 22's most popular dishes. I highly recommend it and am excited to try more Puerto Rican cuisine after our meal here. Mofongo and marinated chicken - The mofongo was a great base for the flavors of the marinated chicken, which was creamy and peppery. Fried plantains - The sweet, crispy plantains provided a nice contrast to the soft, savory mofongo. Smoked ham and veggie sofrito and rice - The sides made this platter even more satisfying. The sofrito and rice were savory bites I kept coming back to for variety in texture and flavor."

        "Will E.": "We wanted to go to some place we haven't been before so I found this place on yelp. We didn't have a reservation and was worried that we wouldn't be able to get a table since the place is pretty small but we got lucky and got a table right away. Timing is everything. We ordered the Mofongo as a side, the Permil Asado, and the Fried Chicken. Mofongo was prepared and tasted good. Could've used some more seasoning but still good.  Fried Chicken was cooked perfect and seasoned well. Needed a few more pieces of chicken but other than that delicious. It came with a small salad, tostones, rice and beans. Everything on the plate was delicious. The beans are killer.  Lastly the Pernil Asada was so darn delicious, it was tender and seasoned perfect. It also came with a salad, rice, beans, and sweet plantains. Everything tasted great. I took some more beans home they were that good."

The dish itself just felt too sweet. Maybe from the plantains. The vibes inside are cool though and dance music makes it feel lively."

And the waitstaff is always very kind! They honestly never miss and that's why i always come back :)"

Nice rooftop bar with an atrium in case it gets cold. Comfortable seating and pleasant staff. Our waitress was super nice and down to earth not annoying.  All the drinks i had were very good and well made.  The only feedback i would have since they are just starting is that 1) the cheese spread is way too expensive for what it is and not even goood, three of us didnt even eat it and crackers are wayyy too salty.  2) there aren't many veggie options.... The corn dogs veggie style were good though The bon veggie food looked bomb."

A childhood favorite so live the nostalgia in the drink. Also got the pcp cocktail which was a beautiful poor of the orange into the plblue that made my drink colorful in orange and purple. Right front the beginning to end service was splendid, attentive, and stellar. The host at the front was really friendly and upstairs I was checked In by Jackson who was really knowledgeable of the three new drinks and gave them great reviews! So I went in and tried 2 of the three new drinks which far exceeded my expectations. I had a reservation that my friend made at 5:30 at opening but she was running late so she moved it to 6 so I got the chance to come in early have a drink prior and enjoy the view. Thanks so much to Jackson for getting me to my table early and also providing the warm blanket and brief story of this beautiful rooftop. Now my fave rooftop in sf!  I'll be back !"

        "Frank L.": "Amazing drinks. We tried like 4 and they were all good. Personal favorite was the one way ticket. Food is actually pretty good too. Though we only tried the fried chicken, they were really juicy and the seasoning was on point! The fried chicken also comes with 3 sauces so that you don't get bored tho it's good even without the sauces. The fried chicken is good enough to feed 3 people as an appetizer before dinner or a very light meal. Being that it's rooftop bar outside the views were pretty nice too. Overall, def recommend this bar!"

        "Markus N.": "The juxtaposition is striking, obvious, and worth thinking about. In its way, the Tenderloin struggles. Graphed over the years in terms of economic development and opportunity, the line is flat, at best. Its slope, its rise over run, is zero. That's not to say the neighborhood doesn't have heart or promise, it does. It's just pressed down. It wants for a positive slope. Perhaps developments like The Line at first on the fringes will bring visitors sufficiently intrepid to explore some of the other businesses in the TL. There are many worth exploring! Pastries, super tasty cuisine you'll not find where you're hail from. Unless you hail from All Over the World. Then, yes.  Slowly foot traffic increases. Employment perhaps follows. A different kind of attention then begins to derive from otherwise unimaginative electeds. Green health and safety shoots begin to poke up through the cracks in the concrete. Yes. So think on this as you enter the lobby of The Line and catch the lift up to Rise Over Run, San Francisco's newest rooftop spot for cocktails and yummy vittles. The layout is swell, with the enclosed greenhouse to protect one from the SF weather elements and on a warmer day abundant seating outside with views from an intermediate height but high enough for a lovely sunset and an aerie feeling. But better still than the setting and the tasty cocktails and the yummy food and the reasonable price point, better than this which is like all the stars already, better than this is the staff. Front of house, wait staff, mixologists, bus people - so nice, attentive, approachable and humble. This is what makes or breaks a joint for me. And whether its by design, as in they seek out and retain only this kind of person, or by default, as in the house makes this a workplace that simply brings out the best in its people, good job.  You put a smile on our faces that lasted the entire long weekend. Thank you, Rise Over Run for what you do."

        "Fiona Y.": "This is my new favorite bar, so why a 4? The drinks are on point. Ask for their other drink menus, my favorite drink is the A Fooking Pineapple and the apple crumble dessert (I think, it was in a crab cup haha) was amazing. The views of the city are beautiful, it really reminds of a New York lounge and the music was the perfect urban vibe. The diversity and modern cozy decor were so unique to an SF bar, and I absolutely love it here.  Some things to improve: more efficiency with closing tabs (the wait was maybe 20 minutes one time), better heat lamps (it gets cold at night and dancing isn't enough to warm up), and lastly, get better security by the front door. The location is definitely a bit iffy, so please have someone in front of the main door to let people in. I was almost accosted by a homeless man in front since there was no one at the door to let me in even as I was banging on the hotel door. For that reason, I needed to dock a star. Besides that, love it here and will be back!"

We went right at opening and fortunately since it was raining as well there were plenty of seats at the bar.  We got the Full Moon Over Rise and the Tuk Tuk Julius. Both of the drinks were delicious. I was amazed that the Tuk Tuk Julius tasted just like an orange creamsicle! We were both very satisfied with our drinks.  The food however wasn't remarkable. We only had two smaller dishes but the tuna tostada was a bit on the salty side and the chili shrimp were undercooked and not very flavorful. I'd definitely come back again for the view (when it's not raining) and try more of the wonderful drinks."

We got sat down right away.  Ordered the french toast that comes with bacon, potatoes, and a side of Mllionaires bacon. Didn't order the the millionares bacon sampler which comes with 4 types of this bacon but kinda regret it because the side order was very tasty and It made me want more. The millionaires bacon is a thick cut bacon slice with a sweet, savory, salty taste. All types of flavors come out in this bacon. I give it a 10/10 on the bacon. The french toast were fluffy and potatoes had great seasoning. I would come back for the sampler bacon next time.  The area where this restaurant is located is not the best so make sure you park your car somewhere secure. The vibe itself inside the restaurant was nice. It felt like a breakfast restaurant as soon as you walked in. Staff was pleasant and welcoming."

        "Gina N.": "Great Brunch Spot! I heard about the Millionaire bacon, and had to try it! We got the sampler platter, and I never had bacon like this before. It was interesting... The bacon was sweet, like they had been candied. unfortunately, I just wasn't a huge fan of the taste. I also thought the price was steep for 4 pieces of bacon, but still a good experience. We also ended up ordering Omurice, which I thought was pretty okay. The French toast, however, was a standout dish and definitely my favorite item that we ordered. The servers were so accommodating. Although we got to the restaurant at 2, they still let us do bottomless mimosas when the cut-off was supposed to be at 2. At one point, they noticed us rushing to finish our food and drinks to be out by 3, but our server reassured us that there was no rush and to take all the time we needed. At it's peak, there is a bustling, energetic ambiance in the restaurant. It can get a little loud, but nothing out of the ordinary for a brunch place.  Please note that Sweet Maple closes at 3pm on weekends, which caught us off guard when we arrived at 2pm. I recommend planning ahead to make the most of your visit and take advantage of the bottomless mimosas that they offer.  Overall, I had a great experience at Sweet Maple and would definitely recommend it."

I had the gardena soufflegg and I did not like it at all. The egg itself was too salty and the sauted veggies had a funky smell and taste. Now I've never consumed & cleaning products but the dish as a whole tasted like some sort of dish soap. I was thinking the whole time did they not rinse the cookware properly The potatoes on the side has no flavor, no salt, was just very bland. I barely ate any of it, basically ate the toast with butter and called it a day, very disappointing."

One server passively tried to get us to leave after we had paid, but we hadn't hit 2 hours yet * Parking: street parking can be difficult, but there are meters nearby that are about $1.75/hr * Ambiance: it's a nice, modern brunch spot"

I was pleased when the out-of-towner in the group chose it. It was a sunny day after a whole lot of rain, so we enjoyed the 15-minute walk to our destination. None of the three of us had been to Sweet Maple before. One of my lunch companions ordered an impossible burger and the other chose a panino. I ordered the Blackstone Benedict and subbed sweet potato tater puffs for the potato medley. Over the years, I've learned that benedicts come in different forms -- pretty much all of which are tasty -- but this one takes the cake. The delicious, thick, and plentiful Millionaire's Bacon really took this dish from good to great. This was an outstanding meal -- truly one of the best I've had in the Bay Area. The only thing that would have made the experience better is if the heat lamps had actually been on the whole time rather than turned on after we had finished eating and paid the bill and were ready to leave. We had chosen to sit outside because it was a nice day, but it was quite chilly in the shade. We thought the heat lamps were just weak; it turned out they were off."

It was sweet and a little spicy and was so tasty! I really loved the mixture of sweet and regular potatoes as a side. It's a bit on the pricier side with each entree being $23 but for SF it's standard. Would definitely recommend!

When we first arrived the line was out the door and we waited for about 20-25 minutes to be seated, they were super busy and we figured because we heard this was one of the best brunch spots in SF. Once we were seated, the waitress that assisted us was super friendly and gave great service. We started with the BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS & we love that they had 5-6 different flavors, we had them all & they were really delicious. The food was to die for, cooked to perfection and the taste was out of this world. We took a minute to order our food because EVERYTHING sounded good but I'm glad what I ordered.

It's one of those things where there's no perfect bite because every bite is perfect, I really wish I didn't have to share.  The salted egg yolk potatoes. Even good warm the next day, we couldn't finish.  The ribs we fall off the bone tender and sticky and lovely with crispies and mayo. Really. Order these three ( I know I said two but I mean who can pick with tastiest this good) things + maybe the cauliflower or something. Everything was delicious and very flavorful. They don't hold back on bringing a curated plate to your taste buds. Also. They remembered from my reservation I noted have an orange allergy and made an alternate sauce for the dessert which had caracara orange in it. I was sincerely touched.

Ordered the potato's - my least favorite from what we ordered based on flavor wise but the texture was great.  Mala pork ribs- wow, the meat was so soft and tender and fell right off the bone. The flavoring was interesting and had a lot of different sauces, the mala was very light and could barely taste it.  Cauliflower - good but too much sauce , wish it was a bit more crunchier.

Although most of our dishes did taste good, hence the four stars, we each came away feeling our experience was overhyped and overpriced--standard for SF's trendy restaurant scene nowadays. We don't mind putting in the money and effort for dining experiences, but our experience didn't seem worth it. Despite some good parts about out evening, everyone in my party agreed we probably wouldn't return. We ordered honey walnut shrimp & pork toast; kampachi crudo; mala bbq pork ribs; chasao pork ssam; and triple fried chicken wings. We added two sauces: mala chili sauce and ginger scallion relish. Most of the dishes were tasty, interesting, and executed nicely. Our favorites were the honey walnut shrimp toast and ribs. The honey walnut shrimp definitely didn't resemble honey walnut shrimp, but it was still delicious. The wings and pork ssam were good, but not memorable. We all felt the crudo was okay and underwhelming. The two sauces were yummy, and they went well with most of the dishes; we recommend getting them! That said, all the dishes still seemed quite overpriced. The decor felt plain and uninspired. A red-lit ambiance with Bruce Lee playing on the TV didn't quite hit the mark for us. I think I get the vibe they were going for, but we've seen much more creative, interesting interpretations of similar directions at other restaurants. In the end, although most of the food tasted good with some interesting elements, it doesn't stand out enough amongst the plethora of other modern SF restaurants."

Plating and presentation especially exceeded what I would expect for a restaurant at this price point. * All plates are made to share. Portion sizes are small so expect to order multiple menu items.

Staff was quick to respond to any requests from our party. * Staff gave excellent recommendations on the menu. * Nit: It was difficult to understand some of the staff due to the loud atmosphere + accent. Atmosphere * It felt like I was entering a small downtown restaurant in Hong Kong owned by the yakuza * Lots of commotion and packed seating; food looked more upscale than the atmosphere would indicate * PLEASE get rid of the posters on the windows! I thought the restaurant was closed Value * Price point is a bit high for the quantity of food. But, the quality and presentation makes up for it! * Expect better service and seating for the price Conclusion * I would recommend for now. But, I'd need to revisit in a few months to see how the food holds up * I had a pretty good experience overall.

We ordered a bunch of food as you can see from the pictures. My favorites were definitely the fried chicken and the honey walnut toast. Being of Taiwanese descent, I tried to go into this place without any expectations since it was marketed as Taiwanese night market inspired. Nothing about the dishes really reminded me of a Taiwanese night market, expect maybe the portion sizes. A lot of the dishes seemed inspired by Korean (fried chicken) or maybe Cantonese (honey walnut shrimp and char siu). I did not see stinky tofu, fried chicken cutlets, pork/duck blood, or stewed meats that is pretty typical of Taiwanese night market. I might be interested in giving this place another try if a group of friends wanted to go, but not on my own accord. The prices are also really high."

        "Adrienne H.": "As a Taiwanese American, I was very excited to try newly opened Piglet & Co's Taiwanese night market inspired menu. I absolutely loved the food here, but not in the way I initially expected. I found the menu to be a genius mash-up of Taiwanese, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean flavors that embodied being Asian American in California. It was not traditional Taiwanese cuisine at all, but it still evoked feelings of comfort and familiarity. It's also exciting to see how Chef Chris Yang and partner Marcelle Gonzales Yang have evolved the ideas from their Hn-zh and El Chino Grande pop-up days into a full-fledged permanent location. After having tried Chef Yang's cooking at Hn-zh and Hawaiian spot Aina, Piglet & Co feels much more confident and established already. Every dish I tried was standout, but my favorite surprise hit was the charred savoy cabbage. This is not vegetarian or diet-friendly cabbage mind you. The cabbage is thoroughly charred and drenched in creamy pork fat. Exceptionally bright kalo (taro) soubise green sauce cuts through the fat perfectly. I also couldn't resist trying every pork dish on the menu, and all three were decadently good. The honey walnut shrimp & pork toast was a much more generous portion than expected, but I happily scarfed my half down, even knowing the other dishes to come. The chashao pork ssam starred lusciously shiny pork belly, served Korean-style with lettuce wraps and white kimchi. And the mala pork ribs were a delight, with pickled red onion and rice cracker providing a nice contrast. My only disappointment? Not dining with a larger group so I could have tried the rest of the concise menu. I was admiring my neighbor's Chinese steamed whole fish with my already full stomach. Ah, next time!"

Since I had limited time due to travel, I made reservations online a couple weeks before, which required a credit card. The credit card seemed unnecessary since we were only a party of two, but I booked it anyway.  Our server, who was very nice and attentive, suggested we order 2-3 dishes per person. This was our first mistake! The portions were huge, and we would've been happier with 3 or 4 dishes total. This seemed to be the case for many other patrons, since I notice a lot of people taking food home. Half of our dishes went uneaten not only because of the portions, but also because the pork was pretty heavy. The sauce for the Ssam and the Pork ribs tasted exactly the same, too. Parking is limited, so I recommend public transit. Overall, it was a decent experience, but no where on par to similar restaurants like Viridian or Lion Dance Cafe in the East Bay."

The menu is a collection of night marked inspired, relatively smaller plates that are meant to be shared.  For vegetarians it's a nice surprise to see a solid number of options as opposed some places where you only have one uninspired salad or pasta/noodle. It's just a side but I really, really liked the smoked potatoes (without karasumi). For a more filling diah I'd recommend the savory rice porridge and the doubanjiang cauliflower which had a hint of sweetness. There's also a tea menu with some teas that you won't find many other places. For example the fruity Alishan tea from Alishan, Taiwan. The ambiance is great; they have lanterns hanging from the ceiling and in general the entire restaurant has a red glow. They also have a few large TVs which were playing some classic Jackie Chan films. Service was good as well - prompt, friendly and everything was served quite quickly."

Once it was 8pm our table was set and we were seated. Most tables were full when we visited so highly recommend making a reservation.  Drinks: no liquor license at the moment so only non alcoholic beverages were available. Saw they had already submitted a liquor license. Our group decided to stick with water but menu had some interesting non alcoholic wine, beer and tea options.  Food: Kampachi Crudo - nice light refreshing start, fish was fresh, avocado added rich creaminess, mandarins added a pop of citrusy sweetness, wish there was a little bit more saltiness from the soy but overall good Honey Walnut Shrimp Toast with Pork - a crispy shrimp and pork fitter on top of fluffy shokupan toast with a creamy mayo drizzle and smear of walnut relish, really tasty, and such a fun twist on walnut prawns, comes two to an order but pieces were a good size that could be cut up to share, would recommend grabbing an order for the table Mala BBQ Pork Ribs - super tender pork ribs with light mala seasoning, comes four to an order, enjoyed these but wish there was a touch more spice and salt, just needed a little bit more seasoning, I think the chili oil side would pair well with this so consider ordering  Glazed Fried Chicken Wings - delicious, wings were crispy but not greasy, glazed in a sticky sweet and spicy sauce similar to thai sweet chili but a little different, came 5 to an order and was served with pickled dikon and a black sesame slaw, very tasty and a favorite at our table but not particularly special Charred Cabbage - so good, cabbage had a great charred exterior and was soft and tender inside, the chimichurri was bright and herbaceous, there was a creaminess from the kalo (taro) soubise, and a little spiciness from the mustard, a pretty rich dish but great vegetable to round out the meal Smoked Potatoes - baby new potatoes tossed in mayo, and garnished with nori, egg yolk and karasumi, all the flavors blended well together, definitely pops of saltiness from the egg yolk and fish roe, a fun starchy options for the table  Halo Halo - a nice dessert to finish the meal, the coconut sago was barely sweet topped with chewy warm ube mochi, blood oranges, cara cara oranges, blackberries and crisped quinoa, I wish this were slightly sweeter, a drizzle of honey would have really taken this to the next level but we still enjoyed the finish to the meal Service was good they were friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes, checked in regularly to see how our dinner was going. Loved the hot towels with the finger food and the fresh cut orange to finish the meal.  Overall great spot for an asian fusion dinner, i'd say this is a 4.5 out of 5 but rounding up. Food quality was excellent and dishes were well crafted with layers of flavors and textures that provided interesting bites throughout our meal. Chef's really pay attention to the details here which I appreciate. Wish the seasoning on a few of the dishes were more bold but might have just been our dish. Would definitely come back to try the other items on the menu."

        "Bradford L.": "I really wanted to love Piglet & Co because it seemed like a really good restaurant concept on paper. SF lacks good Taiwanese food, and it's even rarer to find street food. However, I felt the food at this place was a huge letdown - it neither reminded me of Taiwanese food nor the Taiwanese street food I grew up eating.  We ordered quite a few dishes per our waiter's recommendation - honey walnut shrimp toast, mala pork ribs, charred savoy cabbage, smoked potatoes, and their sago, fruit, and taro ball dessert.  The honey walnut shrimp and pork toast was probably the best thing I ate. Savory, a little sweet, and a good crunch with the bread. The mala pork ribs had zero mala flavor (numbing & spice), and it just tasted like soy sauce glazed ribs. The savoy cabbage was quite heavy, so after a few bites, it wasn't something I could continue eating. The side of smoked potatoes were a bit forgettable. Lastly, the sago in the dessert was good, but the taro balls lacked the QQ texture I was used to.  Overall, I was quite disappointed - if the restaurant concept had said this was a Asian fusion restaurant, I would rate this place differently. Nothing on the menu reminded me of Taiwan street food. Unfortunately, I don't see myself recommending this place to others or going back myself again."

They're most famous for the Ube hotcakes but I think the portion is too big for one person so that's why I think it's a good \"sharing\" brunch item for the table.  Their Ube drinks are good but personally not a fan of the horchata given I don't like cinnamon but to each their own!  They also sit big parties (and can reserve) so if you're looking for a brunch of 5+ great choice."

        "Jubriel M.": "Food: 10 out of 10 would recommend. Honestly, if everything else--service, ambiance, wait times--were horrible, I'd still recommend going, just for the food.  We were fatties and ordered way too much (Bistek, Tito Boi, Ube Mini Pancake Stack, Turon). It was all good. Just a heads up the mini pancake stack of ube is PLENTY. Unless you're carbo loading for some athletic event the mini pancake stack hits the sweet spot. Seriously, go get the food there.  Oh and we got the Matcha Latte and Vietnamese Coffee with Ube. Also delicious. I wish we could taste more Ube with the Coffee but , its to be expected, as with most things coffee related, coffee tends to be the dominant flavor profile.  The food arrived in a relatively quick manner. Considering how packed it was, I was expecting the food to take a really long time, but it didn't. I'd say about an average wait period.  Service: Absolutely fantastic. They were attentive without hovering, friendly without being too pushy, and were there when you needed them. What else could you ask for.  Ambiance: The place is really sunny and bright, nicely decorated as well, and since they're so busy there's a constant humdrum of social conversation. Honestly, their popularity is a bit of a double edged sword here because the only noticeably \"negative\" thing that I could point out is that the place was very crowded and the tables are kind of close together. Even that kind of goes away once the food arrives lol. A stomach full of delicious ube pancakes and what is essentially shrimp and grits will often do that .  Wait List: Because of it's popularity, I'd recommend doing a reservation. They say wait times are usually about an hour. However, because we're both lazy and impulsive we just decided to walk up, and despite being fully packed we were seated in like 15 minutes. Another kudos!"

        "Anvita S.": "Yes the ube hotcakes are definitely worth trying. The accompanying sauce and fruit toppings created the perfect balance of sweetness with the warm and fluffy pancakes. So glad they had the mini version which was more than enough for me. I'd also definitely recommend the shrimp and grits which was a savory option; the broth was very satisfying and hearty. Great tater tots, guava juice and ube flavored drink. I'd 100% order the drinks again. The short rib dish was a bit too heavy for me personally but thought the tofu sisig was pretty good. I grabbed an earlier reservation on Yelp for a Sunday morning which worked out well."

        "Mark D.": "We came on a weekday and it wasn't busy at all. We got seated immediately and scanned their QR code for the menu. Since it was in a weekday, we ordered through their weekday menu.  I ordered the grilled pork belly which comes with jasmine rice, pineapple mac salad, spicy vinegar sauce and 2 fried eggs ($24). I also ordered the ube hotcakes ($18). There is an option to order a mini for $16.  The ube pancakes came first and the plate was huge! It was also presented nicely and great for pictures! The ube wasn't that sweet. The sauce had a coconut ube mix but still tasted good. The blueberries and strawberries were a nice touch as well as the shredded coconut. The pork belly was probably my favorite. Reminded me of liempo. The fried egg was a little running but that's how I like my eggs so that's a plus. Mac salad was okay but it's nice to eat it here in SF.  Overall, good food and good vibes. Atmosphere here is very modern and fancy. Staff are friendly and welcoming. A lot of street parking in the area. They are unable to split checks but that wasn't to big of an issue. I would recommend eating here!"

We were a party of 3 and thankfully they had bar seating open so we sat there (is a bit tight though and you're not actually in front of a bar it's kinda just a wall). So would definitely recommend to come early or book a reservation in advance! We ordered the pork belly, ube french toast, niloco mo ako, chicken wings & waffles, and a side of waffle fries and eggs. I was really excited to try the loco moco, but honestly it wasn't anything too soecial but it was good! I would say the highlights of our meal were the ube french toasts and the chicken wings & waffles.  Atmosphere is a bit loud if you don't mind that and the workers were nice, considering how busy they were too. They had a daily specials menu which was sweet, but didn't get to try anything off of it."

We started off the meal with a round of guava mimosas and viet coffee with ube foam for the table. The coffee was so rich and creamy! I got the niloco mo ako and man, it was jam packed with so much flavor and the ribs were very tender. We also tried the ube pancakes, which I highly recommend if you are wanting something sweet. The pancakes were airy and the ube cream around it made it the perfect end to our brunch.  Parking around here can get busy especially on the weekends, so if you can definitely uber! Service here was amazing as we really liked our waiter who was kind and attentive and gave us great recommendations since it was our first time."

        "Christina L.": "Who could say no to Filipino Brunch? LOCATION: Alnico is located on Valencia Street in San Francisco.  ORDER: |-| Chicken Wings-n-Waffles ($22) - Honey-soy glaze, waffles, and black sesame butter. The chicken wings had great flavor, were fried well, and still super tender. The waffles were a bit average - nothing special about them but the black sesame butter was interesting to try. |-| Mini Ube Hotcakes ($14) - Ube coconut sauce and berries. The mini ube hotcakes were delicious (if you like ube desserts). Pancakes were light and fluffy but you had to pair it with the ube coconut sauce otherwise they were a bit bland. The sauce itself was lightly sweet and not too heavy.  SUMMARY: The food was really good! Unfortunately, the weekday menu has fewer items than the weekend menu which I wasn't aware of until after I went. If you're looking for more options, make sure to go on the weekend (but then you may have to deal with a wait)."

Even the next day if you reheat the pizza, it tastes like it came straight out of the oven! Every pizza is delicious but our favorites are the carbonara pizza and the spicy Calabrian pizza.  Their Caesar salad was really flavorful too.  The indoor decor is lovely. Feel like the perfect combo of fancy and chill, romantic and fun, or even if you just want a bite and glass of wine by yourself this spot is great - the bar area is so fun.

        "Jenny W.": "4.5 stars Great option if you're looking for last minute reservations. That's how I came across this spot, but I actually ended up being super impressed with the food. We started with the broccolini and the meatballs. Both were good but not the star of the show.  The star of the show are the pinsas. This is the kind of pizza I love - fresh toppings + airy dough without the greasiness of most pizzas so you don't feel terrible after eating it. I got the prosciutto & straciatella pinsa which was tasty, although I did find myself wishing I had gotten the mushroom or carbonara pinsa since those seemed more flavorful / savory. I love prosciutto pizzas and while this one was no different, I will say it wasn't quite as cohesive as the best prosciutto pizzas I've had, and it was a bit hard to eat since the toppings kept falling off. The only other pinsa shop I've tried in the city is Montesacro, and I actually enjoyed my pinsa here more (although part of that may just be because I liked my toppings better here - my boyfriend prefers Montesacro)."

        "Kaley N.": "Great food, really put off by the hostess awkwardly telling us that we had a 60-min time limit on our table. I want to be extra clear, the food was great! I got the Carbonara pizza and the Prosciutto pizza to split with my friend. We loved them both - they really hit the right balance of a both crispy and chewy crust. So so good What really put off both my friend and I was immediately after we were seated at our table (6pm reservation, sat around 605pm because we were 2mins late) another woman/hostess (not the same person that sat us) came by and whispered to us that they had another party coming right at 7 so we only had a 60-min time limit for our table. And when I say whispered, I mean whispered - I had to ask the woman to speak up because I couldn't hear what she was saying at first. It was really uncomfortable.  I'm all for transparency on table time limits, but this was not clear when I made the reservation. I also think 60-mins for a sit down dinner reservation is a bit quick.  Because it was such an awkward interaction with this woman, we ordered immediately when our waiter came back. We didn't receive our food until sometime around 6:35/6:40, so we felt really uncomfortable about making sure we were done with dinner, paid and out by 7pm. I would highly recommend being a bit more transparent about your time limits, but I'd also recommend increasing table time limits to at least 75mins so people don't have to feel rushed."

We walked in on a friday night a little before 6:30pm and was seated at the bar. Food came super quick!  We ordered the pork & beef meatballs ($13), truffle cheeks pizza ($21) and the beef & arugula salad ($14). The meatballs were ok, a little too salty in my opinion, but liked that it came with some bread! The arugula salad was beautifully plated and and lots of beets! l I liked that they were sliced thinly rather than in chunks. The pizza was the highlight! The crust was light and airy, yet slightly chewy- it was so so good. The truffle wasn't overpowering and not too salty from the pork, and perfect amount of cheese. Would get this again!  Overall, quick service and tasty pizza. One of the better restaurants on fillmore in my opinion!"

        "Jenny Z.": "Not too cheesy, unique delicious toppings, crisp fluffy crust. The taste profile of the pinsa here is very similar to that of wood oven pizza, so it did not have as much of the wow factor, but it definitely did taste lighter than your typical pizza.  -Positano (4.5/5): I was eyeing this one from the get go, and it was delicious! The ingredients were so simple yet complemented one another so well -- light touches of ricotta with mortadella and pistachio for a nice crunch. -Portofino (3.5/5): This one was also really good -- loved the fig jam for a touch of sweetness. But I did feel like I was really just eating cheese and fig jam. The prosciutto shriveled up and there were barely any pieces. The cheese also got cold really quick and I think this one is best enjoyed warm. The sweet salty flavor was really nice though. Overall, it's a great spot to go with a friend! I love that you're able to cut up the pinsa yourself. The main thing I wish is that there was some means of keeping the pinsa warm and heated throughout the dinner."

        "Queena Z.": "This was a cute restaurant with great ambiance on a very lively street in SF. They were quite busy when we arrived at 6:40pm ish. They have both indoor and outdoor seating with heater. However, the service tends to be a bit slow maybe because they're understaffed. CLASSIC CAPRESE: i was a little disappointed with this because I was expecting sweet cherry tomatoes but they were normal tart cherry tomatoes. The cheese was creamy and the seasoning was nice. But I think the whole dish would've been even better with sweet tomatoes.  HEARTY TRUFFLE PIZZA: I really like their pizza dough! I'm not a huge fan of truffle flavor because it could be overpowering and too much after eating it for a while, but luckily I didn't feel like the truffle oil was too strong on the pizza. The pizza was nice and well balanced with the creamy white sauce and cheese, chewy and crispy dough, slightly salty meat, and truffle oil.  PROSCIUTTO & STRACCIATELLA: I thought I would really like this pizza but turns out I'm not a huge fan of it. I feel like all the ingredients didn't harmoniously well in my mouth for some reason. I think I'm not a big fan or buratta on pizza because it's like melty and doesn't act like a glue with the other ingredients on the pizza."

He forgot to add the crab to another order, which he was sure to mention a additional $5 dollar charge. No worries sir we can totally pay for everything we ordered.

We decided to walk around North Beach to find something quick and easy, but we ended up not walking far as we landed at California Fish Marker Restaurant, which was located right next to Sotto Mare. The place wasn't busy, and there was plenty of seating. I explained to our server that we were on a time crunch, and he assured us that we would be out of the restaurant in time for our appointment and with plenty of time to spare. He did not disappoint us, and what's great was that we didn't feel rushed either. We ordered a few items to share among the 3 of us, including the fried mixed seafood platter, uni bucatini pasta, and a crab linguini pasta. Overall, the food was satisfying. I loved the fried seafood platter that consisted of calamari, shrimp, and zucchini. Interestingly, each item had a different batter. Well, the shrimp and zucchini had a more similar thick batter, whereas the calamari had a lighter tempura style batter. Everything was perfectly friend and crunchy.  The second item I enjoyed was the crab linguini. It came in a tomato-based sauce and was loaded with bits of crab meat.  The uni pasta was OK, and candidly, I've had better. It had chunks of cooked uni or perhaps the uni cooked while being mixed in with the hot pasta, which made the texture of the uni a little rubbery compared to having it fresh. This pasta had a nice cream-based sauce, but I found that the uni flavor was barely there. I'm also not generally a fan of bucatini because it's a challenging pasta to eat (like eating a straw)."

They provided us with chili oil to add for spice, and everything went well together. The red sauce version of spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare is equally wonderful and loaded with seafood.

The inside isn't the largest, but since we made a reservation the four of us were able to be seated pretty quickly. I definitely got Fish Market vibes from this place, as the decor was all ocean/seafood related and was pretty nice. The waiters here seemed fine, and usually were pretty responsive when we called them over.  For the food, we decided to get a crab chowder, lobster roll, and grilled calamari (along with some complimentary bread and butter). The grilled calamari was pretty good, as it was flavorful and had a lot of sauce in it. The lobster roll seemed pretty standard as it didn't blow me away or anything, but I think it is still a decent dish. The crab chowder seemed pretty similar to clam chowder to me to be honest, and I feel it wasn't anything too special.  Overall, I think this place is pretty good to check out if you want some seafood around North Beach. While there definitely are places with higher quality seafood, California Fish Market Restaurant is not bad for the price."

The chicken was a little dry and honestly could've used some lemon or more seasoning. The Cajun shrimp was delicious but you don't get a lotta shrimp.  The potatoes are good, with the dipping sauce and a great shareable. The mushrooms were alright, don't know if I'd order again. The sangria is classic and never a bad option for sharing. The 32oz is perfect to share with a couple of people and great adult beverage option. Weekday Lunch isn't as busy, so if you are in the area and want a nice sit down meal, this is a solid place to check out."

        "Erica Y.": "Food- phenomenal. We got the jerk chicken, and the chicken fell off the bone. It had the perfect amount of sauce that was so good to eat with the rice. The flavors were hitting the spot!!! We also got the chicken paillard, but we asked to get it with the sauce that comes with Cajun shrimp instead, and it was amazing. The bread came with it. And we put butter on the bread, and then dipped it in the sauce and it was to die for.  Drinks- they got the job done. The margarita was made well and well balanced! The spicy mezcal old fashioned was a little too spicy for me, but it's so close. I feel like just a couple of tweaks and it would be a great drink.  Service- amazing. They were so nice from the moment they seated us, and everything came out in a timely manner. We sat at the bar, and had a good time!"

I haven't been here since I was close to their age! Hard to believe that the food is as good as it was back then! Everything we ordered was really good and the environment was just as fun as I remembered. We had fried calamari, fried new potatoes, BBQ chicken quesadilla and the braised pork and yucca. The pork was so tender. It was a comfort food, served with sourdough and sauces. The calamari came with two dipping sauces and had a perfect crunch, but needed a sprinkle of salt. The quesadilla was stacked full of chicken and was gobbled up quickly. The potatoes were seasoned well and air fried crisp and also had fun dipping sauces.  A fun place to visit and more on the menu to explore for next time."

They also give out free bread.  Customer Service: It was good but can be better. I just don't like how I had to ask for my free bread when they just served it to the group of people. Idk if it's bc I was by myself or they just forgot lol.  Ambience: Super cute colorful unique decor and fun vibes; perf spot to have dinner w fam/friends. Parking: Horrible! Haight is a busy street with a bunch of cute restaurants/bars. I ended up parking at Kezar st (which is only 7 mins walk to the restaurant). I recommend parking here instead of wasting 30 mins looking for street parking.  Def worth the trip here and I would go back here with my friends."

I think it's pretty new so it wasn't busy on a Wednesday, but I'm sure it's going to attract lots of attention soon! My friend is from Bangladesh, which has similar cuisine to Pakistan, so she was excited to see a Pakistani restaurant. And she definitely approved of the food! We ordered: Veggie Pakora Fritters, Chicken Karahi, Chicken Jalfrazi, Garlic Naan and a side of rice. Everything was SO GOOD! Especially the naan - omg when they come out fresh and piping hot, this was definitely the best naan I've ever had in my life. Altogether, the bill was $60 (after tax and tip) and we had a ton of leftovers, so really good price for SF!  My only critique is that it's clear the people who run the restaurant are new to the business so they're still ironing out some kinks. For example they never refilled our waters for the whole meal. When we asked for takeout containers, they gave us the super flimsy plastic clamshells which are terrible for spicy curries, lol. But I'm sure they'll figure this stuff out soon. Overall highly recommend if you want to try good south Asian food in SF!"

        "Lisa X.": "New Indian and Pakistani Halal restaurant in the Inner Richmond. Walked by recently and saw that Chaska opened at what used to be a ramen place that was emptied for a long period of time. Glad to see a new business in the neighborhood. Certainly piqued our interest. We used our phones to view the QR code menu, ordered, and paid before sitting down.  What we got: chicken tikka masala, nihari beef, garlic naan and chai. The owner was super friendly and told us they have only been opened a week ago, then being extremely kind, he gifted us a plate of basmati rice (ate there) and two gulab jamun (we took to-go). Everything smells deliciously aromatic. The chicken tikka masala - tender chicken, delicious, tomatoe-y Goes so well with the basmati rice. Hb said that it's like having this delicious tomato soup with chicken in it. The nihari beef (slow cooked boneless beef with bone marrow, garnished with cilantro, ginger and a slice of lemon) was fantastic. Slightly spicy due to the ginger and spices, beefy brothy sauce, tender beef pieces, and a bit citrusy from the lemon slice that refreshes the palate. This pairs so well with the freshly made naan. Although we didn't regret getting the garlic naan, we felt that this dish would be just as good with regular naan as not to compete with the other spices and flavors. The chai was very good. And so was the gulab jamun that was packed for to-go and we didn't have until we got home. Besides offering chicken, beef, fish, and veggies dishes, this restaurant has an extensive menu on goat and lamb dishes. Something I don't often see. Although we weren't adventurous enough to try those this time, we will probably try them in the near future.  In summary: Tasty & delicious food, generous and kind people, and clean restaurant.  Give them a try!"

The waiters have also been very friendly and accommodating, and keep the complimentary chips and salsa flowing.  In the two visits we have dined here we have tried the tacos, chilaquiles, super burrito, and enchiladas. Everything has been delicious, and the \"cheesy crust\" on the burrito is a must try. They take a burrito, cover the exterior in cheese and then crisp it. It's incredible!  As a last note I highly recommend the al pastor for the meat choice, you can't go wrong with any of the picks, but the al pastor really shines. It's tender, juicy and stands out especially well when paired with the tacos or burritos."

We chose a table to sit at and ordered a Cuban Chicken Sandwich and also a Super Burrito with carne asada for the meat and also added a cheesy crust to the burrito. The food here also comes with a complimentary side of nachos with salsa dips too, so I thought that was nice. Then the food came and my burrito looked burnt! I ended up peeling most of the burnt cheese off of the burrito, which is a little sad since it costs extra for that cheese crust. That Super Burrito was also very oily and messy, so I wasn't a huge fan of that even though the taste was good. After that, I tried the Cuban Chicken Sandwich and that was very good! I loved how crispy the chicken was and the meat wasn't too dry. The fries that the chicken sandwich came with were also very good since it was seasoned. I'd recommend this place depending on what items you get! I would NOT recommend adding a cheese crust to the burritos here because of how burnt and oily my Super Burrito got. I would recommend other items like the Cuban Chicken Sandwich since that was very tasty and filling. I also liked how they give you a complimentary bowl of nachos with salsa."

Very generous portion and beautiful presentation of a meaty chicken leg and thigh, with rice, beans and pica de gallo. The chicken skin was crispy and delicious. The chicken itself was very moist. We were also given a very cold purple drink. Was it cinnamon? It had a tiny bit of pulp. I like pulp but was not a fan of the drink even when we added vodka! The food however was terrific. I loved every bite of it. I sent a picture of this to my girlfriend in Pittsburgh. She thought it looked hot. It isn't. It is spicy in a good way, not the have to get a glass of water quickly way. Good find for us and easy to get to on 38 busses at either 12th or Park Presidio."

A burrito that will fill you up... all while having a side of CHIPS AND SALSA!!! Yayyyyy  You a little skeptical cause there are only 148ish reviews? Or you a little skeptical because it's a 4.5 star establishment? Fret no more. I took a scroll through the first couple of 4 star reviews that are on the page and it really says NOTHING bad about the food nor the service. I think those reviews should be 5 stars. The server is extremely kind and accommodating. When we needed him, he addressed what we needed. Food came out quickly and filled me up!!! Got the Al pastor and it was packed with flavor!! They put a nice crisp to the outer tortilla wrap so it's got a nice crunch to every bite!!  I did want to mention ! Though the menu says $15 , you Area charged $15.60 and horchata had a similar increase, so it looks like there was a recent 4% increase on the price of the food.  Horchata was pretty darn fresh and relaxing especially with the massive burrito!!! $2 for a refill!"

We tried coming on a Saturday and they were close at lunch for a Quinceaera so glad we were able to make it back. I really enjoyed the ribs, they were fall of the bone and very saucy (maybe a little too saucy) but still good flavor and some amazing sides. There was rice,beans, corn salad, and maybe some coleslaw. Too many jalapeos for me but easy to pick off. There was just a lot going on in that to go box but I am not complaining. I enjoyed every bite. Hubby had the Cuban chicken sandwich which came with curly fries. The fried chicken paired with crunchy, tangy coleslaw was a hit. We have a baby so of course all the food when I got around to eating it was cold but the sandwich was still enjoyable cold.  I also got an Al Pastor taco which had fresh pieces of pineapple in it and a very generous amount of meat. We really enjoyed this place and would like to come back and actually try their burrito next time."

The seaweed and egg rice also goes very well with the raw shrimp.  Next favorite is probably the bossam (you can get without oysters!) the pork was very chewy and doesn't have the typical smell / taste that pork has at times.  Very good to have something soupy and it comes with an insane amount of food!! The soup is on the sweeter end almost like a Japanese sukiyaki.

My favorites are: - Korean fried chicken: this is the BEST KFC in the city! The batter is so light and crispy, and the interior is super juicy. I love dipping it in their gochujang sauce too. - Soy cured raw shrimp: if you like marinated raw crab, you're going to love this! Mix the egg yolk seaweed rice up and spoon the soy sauce over it--sooo good. The soy sauce is sweet and savory deliciousness. I could probably eat a whole plate of the shrimp myself! - Budae jjigae: their army stew is so comforting and spicy. I love how much meat & veggies are in the pot. Great as leftovers too (bc the pot is huge!!) - Corn cheese tots: I love corn cheese so I KNEW I was gonna love this dish. I still have to try the bulgogi tots, but these, along with the gochujang mayo, are delightful with the pops of corn and melted cheese. Service is extremely friendly. It's a somewhat small spot, so make a reservation in advance (especially because they're becoming more popular lately)!"

        "Dominic B.": "Visited ILCHA for a going away dinner for two friends. We booked reservations for 4 ahead of time via their website, which I highly recommend doing. There's a good chance you won't get a table via walk in and I also recommend booking ahead to ensure availability.  As one of my favorite restaurants in SF, we wanted to show our friends this gem before they moved away from SF. We ordered a number of our favorite dishes including ganjang saewoo + gyrean bap, bossam + oysters, budae jjigae, and Korean fried chicken.  The shrimp, which is raw and soy cured, came out first and we were provided gloves to keep our fingers clean during eating. Once you peel your shrimp, I definitely recommend dipping it back in the sauce it came in. Next was the bossam + oysters, which gives you flexibility to make your own lettuce wraps. A newer discovery of ours, I recommend putting the braised pork belly and oyster in a wrap together and trying it; the texture and flavor is wild and so tasty. This was followed by the Korean fried chicken which is my personal favorite. The chicken is incredibly juicy, very hot, and the batter is light so it doesn't feel too filling. Pair this with the gochujang sauce. We finished off with the budae jjigae, another favorite of mine. The hot pot is one of the spicier options on the menu, but not overbearing lot spicy. As the hot pot heated up on our table, the staff helped us mix in and ramen noodles and American cheese and maintain proper temperature. This dish is spicy, savory, and well rounded and a perfect shareable for 2-4 people."

What we've ordered Fried chicken - 5/5 Definitely a must order! The outside is very crispy and the chicken inside is very juicy, it goes very well with the sauce they gave you.  Cheese tteok kkochi - 5/5 I'm not a cheese lover but it was very well roasted with cheese and it was amazing. The rice cake itself was very chewy and not hard at all.  Bulgogi tater totes - 5/5 All flavors blends very well. Tater toes were very crispy and crunchy.  Marinated shrimp - 5/5 MUST ORDER, it is extremely fresh! The marinated sauce goes so well with the raw shrimp together. We just can't stop eating it. Budae jjigae- 3/5 Probably the most disappointing dish but still good, both me and my friend think it needs some flavors. But the portion was good, and it came with ramen so you don't have to order it separately. Overall I'd definitely come back to this place to try more dishes"

Unless you're carbo loading for some athletic event the mini pancake stack hits the sweet spot. Seriously, go get the food there.  Oh and we got the Matcha Latte and Vietnamese Coffee with Ube. Also delicious. I wish we could taste more Ube with the Coffee but , its to be expected, as with most things coffee related, coffee tends to be the dominant flavor profile.  The food arrived in a relatively quick manner. Considering how packed it was, I was expecting the food to take a really long time, but it didn't. I'd say about an average wait period.  Service: Absolutely fantastic. They were attentive without hovering, friendly without being too pushy, and were there when you needed them. What else could you ask for.  Ambiance: The place is really sunny and bright, nicely decorated as well, and since they're so busy there's a constant humdrum of social conversation. Honestly, their popularity is a bit of a double edged sword here because the only noticeably \"negative\" thing that I could point out is that the place was very crowded and the tables are kind of close together. Even that kind of goes away once the food arrives lol. A stomach full of delicious ube pancakes and what is essentially shrimp and grits will often do that .  Wait List: Because of it's popularity, I'd recommend doing a reservation. They say wait times are usually about an hour. However, because we're both lazy and impulsive we just decided to walk up, and despite being fully packed we were seated in like 15 minutes. Another kudos!"

        "Anvita S.": "Yes the ube hotcakes are definitely worth trying. The accompanying sauce and fruit toppings created the perfect balance of sweetness with the warm and fluffy pancakes. So glad they had the mini version which was more than enough for me. I'd also definitely recommend the shrimp and grits which was a savory option; the broth was very satisfying and hearty. Great tater tots, guava juice and ube flavored drink. I'd 100% order the drinks again. The short rib dish was a bit too heavy for me personally but thought the tofu sisig was pretty good. I grabbed an earlier reservation on Yelp for a Sunday morning which worked out well."

        "Mark D.": "We came on a weekday and it wasn't busy at all. We got seated immediately and scanned their QR code for the menu. Since it was in a weekday, we ordered through their weekday menu.  I ordered the grilled pork belly which comes with jasmine rice, pineapple mac salad, spicy vinegar sauce and 2 fried eggs ($24). I also ordered the ube hotcakes ($18). There is an option to order a mini for $16.  The ube pancakes came first and the plate was huge! It was also presented nicely and great for pictures! The ube wasn't that sweet. The sauce had a coconut ube mix but still tasted good. The blueberries and strawberries were a nice touch as well as the shredded coconut. The pork belly was probably my favorite. Reminded me of liempo. The fried egg was a little running but that's how I like my eggs so that's a plus. Mac salad was okay but it's nice to eat it here in SF.  Overall, good food and good vibes. Atmosphere here is very modern and fancy. Staff are friendly and welcoming. A lot of street parking in the area. They are unable to split checks but that wasn't to big of an issue. I would recommend eating here!"

We were a party of 3 and thankfully they had bar seating open so we sat there (is a bit tight though and you're not actually in front of a bar it's kinda just a wall). So would definitely recommend to come early or book a reservation in advance! We ordered the pork belly, ube french toast, niloco mo ako, chicken wings & waffles, and a side of waffle fries and eggs. I was really excited to try the loco moco, but honestly it wasn't anything too soecial but it was good! I would say the highlights of our meal were the ube french toasts and the chicken wings & waffles.  Atmosphere is a bit loud if you don't mind that and the workers were nice, considering how busy they were too. They had a daily specials menu which was sweet, but didn't get to try anything off of it."

We started off the meal with a round of guava mimosas and viet coffee with ube foam for the table. The coffee was so rich and creamy! I got the niloco mo ako and man, it was jam packed with so much flavor and the ribs were very tender. We also tried the ube pancakes, which I highly recommend if you are wanting something sweet. The pancakes were airy and the ube cream around it made it the perfect end to our brunch.  Parking around here can get busy especially on the weekends, so if you can definitely uber! Service here was amazing as we really liked our waiter who was kind and attentive and gave us great recommendations since it was our first time."

        "Christina L.": "Who could say no to Filipino Brunch? LOCATION: Alnico is located on Valencia Street in San Francisco.  ORDER: |-| Chicken Wings-n-Waffles ($22) - Honey-soy glaze, waffles, and black sesame butter. The chicken wings had great flavor, were fried well, and still super tender. The waffles were a bit average - nothing special about them but the black sesame butter was interesting to try. |-| Mini Ube Hotcakes ($14) - Ube coconut sauce and berries. The mini ube hotcakes were delicious (if you like ube desserts). Pancakes were light and fluffy but you had to pair it with the ube coconut sauce otherwise they were a bit bland. The sauce itself was lightly sweet and not too heavy.  SUMMARY: The food was really good! Unfortunately, the weekday menu has fewer items than the weekend menu which I wasn't aware of until after I went. If you're looking for more options, make sure to go on the weekend (but then you may have to deal with a wait)."

Everything is fresh, hot chips, unique salsas, and delicious meats have made this our new go to for Mexican food in the city. The waiters have also been very friendly and accommodating, and keep the complimentary chips and salsa flowing.  In the two visits we have dined here we have tried the tacos, chilaquiles, super burrito, and enchiladas. Everything has been delicious, and the \"cheesy crust\" on the burrito is a must try. They take a burrito, cover the exterior in cheese and then crisp it. It's incredible!  As a last note I highly recommend the al pastor for the meat choice, you can't go wrong with any of the picks, but the al pastor really shines. It's tender, juicy and stands out especially well when paired with the tacos or burritos."

We chose a table to sit at and ordered a Cuban Chicken Sandwich and also a Super Burrito with carne asada for the meat and also added a cheesy crust to the burrito. The food here also comes with a complimentary side of nachos with salsa dips too, so I thought that was nice. Then the food came and my burrito looked burnt! I ended up peeling most of the burnt cheese off of the burrito, which is a little sad since it costs extra for that cheese crust. That Super Burrito was also very oily and messy, so I wasn't a huge fan of that even though the taste was good. After that, I tried the Cuban Chicken Sandwich and that was very good! I loved how crispy the chicken was and the meat wasn't too dry. The fries that the chicken sandwich came with were also very good since it was seasoned. I'd recommend this place depending on what items you get! I would NOT recommend adding a cheese crust to the burritos here because of how burnt and oily my Super Burrito got. I would recommend other items like the Cuban Chicken Sandwich since that was very tasty and filling. I also liked how they give you a complimentary bowl of nachos with salsa."

Very generous portion and beautiful presentation of a meaty chicken leg and thigh, with rice, beans and pica de gallo. The chicken skin was crispy and delicious. The chicken itself was very moist. We were also given a very cold purple drink. Was it cinnamon? It had a tiny bit of pulp. I like pulp but was not a fan of the drink even when we added vodka! The food however was terrific. I loved every bite of it. I sent a picture of this to my girlfriend in Pittsburgh. She thought it looked hot. It isn't. It is spicy in a good way, not the have to get a glass of water quickly way. Good find for us and easy to get to on 38 busses at either 12th or Park Presidio."

A burrito that will fill you up... all while having a side of CHIPS AND SALSA!!! Yayyyyy  You a little skeptical cause there are only 148ish reviews? Or you a little skeptical because it's a 4.5 star establishment? Fret no more. I took a scroll through the first couple of 4 star reviews that are on the page and it really says NOTHING bad about the food nor the service. I think those reviews should be 5 stars. The server is extremely kind and accommodating. When we needed him, he addressed what we needed. Food came out quickly and filled me up!!! Got the Al pastor and it was packed with flavor!! They put a nice crisp to the outer tortilla wrap so it's got a nice crunch to every bite!!  I did want to mention ! Though the menu says $15 , you Area charged $15.60 and horchata had a similar increase, so it looks like there was a recent 4% increase on the price of the food.  Horchata was pretty darn fresh and relaxing especially with the massive burrito!!! $2 for a refill!"

We tried coming on a Saturday and they were close at lunch for a Quinceaera so glad we were able to make it back. I really enjoyed the ribs, they were fall of the bone and very saucy (maybe a little too saucy) but still good flavor and some amazing sides. There was rice,beans, corn salad, and maybe some coleslaw. Too many jalapeos for me but easy to pick off. There was just a lot going on in that to go box but I am not complaining. I enjoyed every bite. Hubby had the Cuban chicken sandwich which came with curly fries. The fried chicken paired with crunchy, tangy coleslaw was a hit. We have a baby so of course all the food when I got around to eating it was cold but the sandwich was still enjoyable cold.  I also got an Al Pastor taco which had fresh pieces of pineapple in it and a very generous amount of meat. We really enjoyed this place and would like to come back and actually try their burrito next time."

        "David K.": "Lavash serves a refined take on Persian food and is one of the few places in SF to offer this cuisine. We started with the Sabzi Panir, an abundant plate with lavash flatbread squares, sliced Persian cucumbers, sliced tomatoes, grapes, walnuts, blocks of feta cheese, and a mountain of herbs. The little squares of lavash were perfect for making little wraps with all the other ingredients, which were fresh and delicious. We continued with two dips, which also went nicely with the lavash: the Borani, or yogurt mixed with roasted spinach, garlic, and onions, topped with walnuts and saffron; and the Kashk-e-Bademjan, a warm pure of roasted eggplant, garnished with yogurt, sauted onion, roasted black garlic, mint, and saffron.  My favorite dish was the tahdig, made of layers of insanely crispy saffron rice topped with a choice of khoresh (stew). We tried both the Fesenjan, a sweet and sour ground walnut and pomegranate stew with chicken; and the Ghourmeh Sabzi, made of chunks of beef stewed with red kidney beans, herbs, and dried lime. Both the stews were delicious, but the best part was definitely the crispy rice, and ordering the tahdig was a great way to try smaller portions of the stews without having to order the whole entrees. Finally, we had the Taste of Persia, a combination plate of kebabs for two people. This platter came with a skewer each of barg (sliced beef fillet), joojeh (chicken breast and thigh chunks), koobideh (ground beef and lamb), and vegetables (bell pepper, zucchini, onion, tomato), all served with two plates of saffron basmati rice. The skewers were a bit over-charred but were flavorful and tasty nonetheless. Overall, the food at this small restaurant was on point, the atmosphere was elegant, and the service was friendly and attentive too."

Got there right on time and was the first in our party to check in, and surprise surprise they couldn't find my reservation. It's OK as they still had a table inside to offer... When we were all seated, we ordered the Sabzi plate, tahdig with ghaymeh, Kuku Sabzi and the Lavash combination platter. The Sabzi plate was very small with little Lavash bread. The Kuku Sabzi was fine, it was served with a small portion of mast-o-moosir. The tahdig showed up by itself and it took us 10 minutes to catch the server's attention to get the khoresht served. The rice that was served with the kabobs was super greasy with butter, the lamb kabob was great but slightly overdone, chicken kabob was right on and perfect. I didn't even try the koobideh kabob as it looked dry!!! My cousin also had the ashe reshteh and it was made with dried vegetables rather than fresh and the taste was just OK!! Overall, I would give a one for service, a 3 for ambiance and a 2.5 for the food. Hope this was just a bad day for them as I was not impressed at all!!"

        "Elaine Y.": "Came to Lavash and had a wonderful experience! I highly recommend reservations if you prefer to sit indoors. Looking over the menu, several items caught our eyes. We began with the Kashk-e Bademjan which is a seasoned eggplant spread. It was sooo yummy! The consistency was buttery and creamy and finished with just a light smokiness. The bits of mint provided a nice pop of flavor as well. We also went with the Tahdig with Stew opting for the Bademjan Stew. I personally found the crispy rice to be much too hard even as it sat in the stew. The lamb shank stew though was an absolute star. The lamb was not too gamey and fell right off the bone. We also got a little dish of lavash bread, fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, and basil and mint from the house. We loved the freshness of all the ingredients and used the additional lavash to eat up all the eggplant dip! For entrees, we shared the Lavash Special for two and the Zereshk Polo (Jeweled rice). The Lavash Special is highly recommended in my books. It provided the perfect sampling of all the dishes! Additionally every item was cooked to perfection. The lamb was a perfect medium rare and the chicken kabob was so juicy and tender. As for the Jeweled Rice, it was also very tasty but I do think it was a little heavy handed on the barberries which made the bites very tart. Luckily the Lavash Special came with a lot of rice so we just mixed a little in and made it a little more palatable for us. For dessert, we tried the half Falooda and half pistachio gelato. The falooda was really interesting with the vermicelli noodles but we definitely liked trying something so different!  All in all, we really enjoyed our meal. Price was very reasonable and I could definitely see myself returning. The ambiance inside is quite cozy and romantic, perfect for a dinner."

They give a LOT of rice so fair warning. They also give free appetizer. My only feedback is that I wish there was some kind of sauce. Not that the food was bad or anything (sometimes chefs get offended), but just like a little something something to balance the rice."

It took them some time to bring my tea. One of the servers came and apologized and said they are making a new batch. When he brought the tea it was cold . The taste was good though .

The seaweed and egg rice also goes very well with the raw shrimp.  Next favorite is probably the bossam (you can get without oysters!) the pork was very chewy and doesn't have the typical smell / taste that pork has at times.  Very good to have something soupy and it comes with an insane amount of food!! The soup is on the sweeter end almost like a Japanese sukiyaki.

I love dipping it in their gochujang sauce too. - Soy cured raw shrimp: if you like marinated raw crab, you're going to love this! Mix the egg yolk seaweed rice up and spoon the soy sauce over it--sooo good. The soy sauce is sweet and savory deliciousness. I could probably eat a whole plate of the shrimp myself! - Budae jjigae: their army stew is so comforting and spicy. I love how much meat & veggies are in the pot. Great as leftovers too (bc the pot is huge!!) - Corn cheese tots: I love corn cheese so I KNEW I was gonna love this dish. I still have to try the bulgogi tots, but these, along with the gochujang mayo, are delightful with the pops of corn and melted cheese. Service is extremely friendly. It's a somewhat small spot, so make a reservation in advance (especially because they're becoming more popular lately)!"

There's a good chance you won't get a table via walk in and I also recommend booking ahead to ensure availability.  As one of my favorite restaurants in SF, we wanted to show our friends this gem before they moved away from SF. We ordered a number of our favorite dishes including ganjang saewoo + gyrean bap, bossam + oysters, budae jjigae, and Korean fried chicken.  The shrimp, which is raw and soy cured, came out first and we were provided gloves to keep our fingers clean during eating. Once you peel your shrimp, I definitely recommend dipping it back in the sauce it came in. Next was the bossam + oysters, which gives you flexibility to make your own lettuce wraps. A newer discovery of ours, I recommend putting the braised pork belly and oyster in a wrap together and trying it; the texture and flavor is wild and so tasty. This was followed by the Korean fried chicken which is my personal favorite. The chicken is incredibly juicy, very hot, and the batter is light so it doesn't feel too filling. Pair this with the gochujang sauce. We finished off with the budae jjigae, another favorite of mine. The hot pot is one of the spicier options on the menu, but not overbearing lot spicy. As the hot pot heated up on our table, the staff helped us mix in and ramen noodles and American cheese and maintain proper temperature. This dish is spicy, savory, and well rounded and a perfect shareable for 2-4 people."

I would say food is a solid 4.5, ambiance is relaxed and casual, service is OK (although we felt like it was kind of rude that they warned us to finish before 10:00pm since they close at 10:00), food came out quick and we finished everything within an hour.  What we've ordered Fried chicken - 5/5 Definitely a must order! The outside is very crispy and the chicken inside is very juicy, it goes very well with the sauce they gave you.  Cheese tteok kkochi - 5/5 I'm not a cheese lover but it was very well roasted with cheese and it was amazing. The rice cake itself was very chewy and not hard at all.  Bulgogi tater totes - 5/5 All flavors blends very well. Tater toes were very crispy and crunchy.  Marinated shrimp - 5/5 MUST ORDER, it is extremely fresh! The marinated sauce goes so well with the raw shrimp together. We just can't stop eating it. Budae jjigae- 3/5 Probably the most disappointing dish but still good, both me and my friend think it needs some flavors. But the portion was good, and it came with ramen so you don't have to order it separately. Overall I'd definitely come back to this place to try more dishes"

They took our order and delivered it quickly. The restaurant was a very clean, nice esthetics, good and practical use of space, bathrooms were very clean. Food was delicious and nothing to want. No regrets, I was very happy with the fresh squeezed orange juice, my French toast, and all the food was just perfect.  100% would recommend this place"

        "Tim X.": "Came here with a friend on a Sunday. Unlike many other brunch places in San Francisco, we didn't have to wait too long (around 20 minutes) for a table, which was a relief. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the interior was well-decorated. The menu had some unique and non-conventional items that piqued my interest, but I decided to play it safe. Unfortunately, my choice of eggs benedict didn't quite live up to expectations (3/5 stars). The English muffins were burnt, making them difficult to cut into, and the hollandaise sauce was bland. The potatoes and veggies were great, and the fruit was as fresh and tasty as it looked in the picture. My friend's French toast was a solid dish, but she wished there were more toppings to balance out the bread (4/5 stars). I want to give this place another chance as the soft scrambled eggs looked tasty. However, I feel like an eggs benedict is a classic brunch item that shouldn't be hard to mess up. While Wooden Spoon was a decent brunch spot, there is a lot of competition in San Francisco for good brunch places, and I wouldn't go out of my way to return. However, the interesting menu items do intrigue me, so I might give it another shot in the future."

        "Kaanchana A.": "My friends and I came here at 11 am on a sunday and there was about a 20 minute wait which wasn't too bad honestly because it was a nice day out! The service was incredible once we were inside and everyone was kind and attentive. For food, I ordered the big spoon which encompassed all my brunch cravings. The scrambled eggs were creamy, pancakes super fluffy, fruits refreshing, potatoes crispy and the toast was just what you'd want for toast! I also got a latte which was super frothy and I loved that they gave sugar cubes on the side. My friends got a huevos divorciados and the small spoon. Both were delicious from what they said! The hot chocolate was sweet enough but they enjoyed the addition of the two sugar cubes given as well.  I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu :)"

        "Aria H.": "It's my second time coming here, and I love the ambiance. It's such a cozy vibe and the service is great. Our waiter was so sweet and very attentive.  Last time I ordered the Morning Bowl and really enjoyed it. It's a really interesting and fun combination of different veggies, and I would recommend it if you're looking for something less heavy and sweet. My friend ordered it this time and I think she liked it as well.  This time I ordered the Avocado Toast, and I didn't like it as much. I generally don't order Avocado Toast at restaurants but I wanted to give it a chance because I was in the mood for something lighter. However, the pomegranate seeds on top made it a bit sweeter than I would like and I didn't really like the sauce. At $11 I knew it probably wouldn't be anything too crazy, but I was rather disappointed.  I would still come back to get the bowl again or try some of their other menu items. Their sweeter pancake and french toast choices do look really good, as does their eggs benedict. I also like how they open so early in the morning.  Stop by if you're looking for a good brunch place, (just lowkey maybe don't order the Avocado Toast)."

        "Austin Y.": "Banana Pecan Pancakes: 7.5/10 The flavor of the praline sauce paired with the banana well, but I wish there was more sauce because the pancakes were dry. Granola Crunch French Toast: 8/10 The French toast was fluffy and didn't have that eggy flavor that I dislike in most French toasts. The berries and whipped cream complimented the toast nicely along with the crunch of the granola. Again I wish that there were more of the toppings to balance out the amount of bread, but overall I preferred the French toast to the pancakes. We came in at around 9 am on a Sunday and were seated right away.The place was nicely decorated and wasn't too crowded when we came in. Overall was a nice experience, but neither of these menu items stood out to me and I'd probably try something else if I came again."

Wooden Spoon serves probably the best potatoes you can find at any brunch place in SF (or anywhere else); so crispy on the outside, soft and flavorful inside.

        "Nicholas S.": "Cute little hole in the wall place in SF, service was exceptional, and food was mixed. My beef short rib hash was like a 3/5, short ribs were good but the flavor was giving dinner/pot roast flavor. Granola French toast was a 4/5, cooked at too low of heat cause Center was dry but outside was good also whipped cream was bomb. Lastly the fried chicken sandwich was hella good 5/5 bread was soft and probably house made, and the spicy mayo was delicious! I recommend trying different things on the menu!"

All of our food came out pretty fast. We were seated at the communal table and it was not awkward at all (lol). They waitress left a seat open on both sides to create a buffer. We didn't get a chance to try their cocktails but they looked great.  Will definitely come back."

Once seated, the food came out pretty fast. i like that the eggs benedict came with salad and fruit, its always good to balance out a heavy breakfast. But the star of the show, where it was love at first bite, hands down the short rib hash. So flavorful and unique. Wish it came with toast to mop up the juicy goodness.  Only con is that its very loud in the restaurant so you have to shout to hear anything."

We walked into a comfortable bar and coffee shop ambience with very friendly service.  I had a panini sandwich and my daughter had an aa granola fruit bowl. The sandwich's eggs were a bit bland, but I understand some people can't take much salt. Portions were just right for us. Nice spot to enjoy a hearty breakfast on a cold wet day!"

The amount of times I've eaten here is embarrassing but it's just so yummy! Dishes I recommend: - Khao Soi: It is so tasty and flavorful. I get mine with chicken and it never disappoints. Khao Soi is also not as common to find in Thai restaurants around town so I would always recommend trying! It's just an amazing curry noodle soup and they do not hold back on the noodles! - Tom Kha Soup: This is a great dish for a cold, rainy day. I've never had Tom Kha before I ate here and I will say it's still the best I've had. You do have to pay extra for rice on the side, but it's worth. It's just so yummy and has the perfect balance of everything. - Pad See Ew: A classic dish that never fails. It's good here but I'd prefer the two above since they're different than what people usually get at Thai places. Last time I ordered this, it was so flavorful! And they gave me a good amount of beef.  The service is always impeccable. They're so sweet and kind. Also, when I order to-go, they always are attentive and even have offered to let me wait inside for my order when it's cold outside. Couldn't recommend this place enough!"

After realizing that our to-go order was incorrect and inedible, we contacted the restaurant to ask if we can return the untouched food for the correct dish, but instead of resolving the issue, Todd felt the need to angrily repeat that he placed the correct order. He said he'll talk to the manager because he doesn't know how to resolve the issue. However, he continued to repeat himself like a broken record instead of speaking to the manager. I asked if I can speak to his manager since he didn't seem up to the task. Turns out, Todd is the manager! I asked him why he lied. His response, \"If you spoke to my supervisor, the owner, then I'd be responsible.\" Wow, Todd/Songtai. We returned the food and asked for a refund. Todd/Songtai was too lazy to open the bag. Instead, he gave us attitude and asked if we ate the food. No, we are honest people unlike you, Todd/Songtai.

        "Alex C.": "I ordered a pickup, but the server got the order wrong! Apparently, \"Roasted Duck Noodle Soup\" could be mistaken for \"Roasted Duck Curry\" - the latter does not come with noodles. Surprising that one of their most popular items could be mistaken! Instead of coming up with the solution, the server (Todd or Songtai) blamed me for getting the order wrong. I had to go back to the restaurant and return all the food for a refund - all on an empty stomach.  TL;DR, go somewhere else if you want your order to be right (or verify your order multiple times because it's likely to be incorrect). Also, they originally gave me the food with no utensils - I guess you are supposed to use your hands to eat the soup and noodles (who knew!).  For alternatives, check out Wok Shop around the block - they are fast, and the food was good!"

The egg noodle texture seemed off, curry broth was ok - not spicy, three pieces of pork crackling that was a little stale probs from delivery, and surprisingly tough oxtail.  My partner got the Pad Thai medium spicy and it was not spicy at all and actually pretty bland which was the biggest disappointment."

We were seated right away without a reservation on a Friday night - our waiter was very friendly. We ordered: - Spicy Eggplant and Basil with Chicken: the dish came lukewarm, chicken pieces tasted over cooked and dry, lots of onions. Eggplants we're good though. 3/5 - Pad-Ta-Lay: combo seafood dish with salmon, prawns, calamari, and veges. Dish came piping hot, has some slight spice to it, night and day difference from the spicy eggplant dish (makes us kind of wonder if they had pre cooked that dish in advance and it had just been sitting out). 5/5 - Brown rice: came in a cute heart shape, very well cooked, soft and delicious. We ordered another serving half way through our meal! 5/5 - Unsweeted Thai Iced Tea (w/ Yelp check in): pretty good iced tea but not very memorable. 4/5 Overall a great Thai place but not our favorite. Wish they offered the authentic Thai chili sides, and maybe chop sticks instead of a single fork. Minor details of course, but these are things we can't help but notice."

It was light and refreshing and paired perfectly with the food. If you're a fan of Asian-inspired cocktails, get yourself over to Ben Thai. They're a bit on the spendy side, but not bad at all for Nob Hill. I'll be back to try some of their mains."

I love the relaxed ambiance and though this place is small, the seats are set up where each table are back to back. I enjoy this layout because it's easier to have an intimate conversation with your table without others eavesdropping.  My friends ordered a few appetizers and we ordered our entrees swiftly and were able to get our food shortly after. My friends had the roti and were disappointed that there was no dipping curry that came with the roti, but were appeased by the flavors once they took a bite. It was so delicious that they ordered another two orders. The chicken satay was on the dry side and i would skip out on it. The duck curry was the star of the night with the succulent meat covered in a thick delicious curry. The duck was on the plumper side which I prefer and did not taste gamey.  Overall I give this spot a 4.5 and I can't wait to come back to try their other dishes."

We got there about 10 minutes early and asked if we could sit further away from the door since it was a cold day thinking it wouldn't be a big deal. However, the staff that was helping us seemed completely disinterested and annoyed. This was very odd considering there were many tables open at the time.  Happy hour is from 5-7pm. So we decided to start out with 15 oysters which were $2 each and handrolls which were $5 each. Handrolls were pretty good and oyster were not bad as well. We also ordered some Sake as well.  At 6:40 pm, the same staff came and asked if we wanted anything else and that it would be last call (This was weird since happy hour ends at 7pm? lol) Our last friend came a little late and we asked if it was okay for us to order additional things from the happy hour menu. This was at 6:45pm and it was apparent the same staff was extremely annoyed at us and slammed the menu on our table saying \"Okay this is really last call now.\" We were very surprised with the customer service and didn't know what we did to deserve that. It was no where near 7pm and if he really didn't want to offer us the happy hour, then he could've just said so nicely instead of making us 5 girls feel really bad.  Overall, the food was pretty decent. We ordered 2 of the special \"K\" roll (our favorite), Loco Spiderman roll, Big Boss roll, Hamachi Truffle, Chicken Karage, and also Edamame. It's unfortunate that the customer service was so terrible. It just didn't taste as good since we were treated so poorly. We thought the staff probably had a bad day but we could see that he was treating other customers completely different from how he treated us. Not to mention, we were also very rushed during our dinner. It felt like he just wanted us to get out of the restaurant ASAP. I never write bad reviews on yelp (this is actually my first one lol, hopefully the only one) but this was not the best experience for us 5 girls that were here to celebrate our friend's birthday. It's a shame since the other staff members were nice."

I like to try things at least twice and Nara made it official -- I do not like fatty tuna! The star of the show was the avocado ball. I forget the actual name on the menu, but it's an avocado filled with crab meat. It was beyond filling! I couldn't eat my sushi after it. The oysters were good too. Service: The service was a bit slow. Nara wasn't busy when we arrived, so my expectations were a bit high. I expected frequent visits to the table, but none of that happened. Ambiance: I would say that Nara is good for happy hour. The decor is underwhelming...in dire need of a facelift.  If in SF again, I don't think I would revisit."

I was excited because of the omakase. Compared to other places, the prices and the amount of food you get is an amazing deal. The fish slices were thick and the presentation was beautiful. It definitely did not make us full, so we ordered the Special \"K\" roll and my god, it was literally so mouthwatering and delicious! Butterfish is one of my favorite fishes and there hasn't been many places where i've seen them serve it as a roll, so this was by far my favorite dish out of the whole evening! It was so good I ordered a second one which I never do!  Not only was the food delicious, but also the service from the workers were so amazing and down to Earth! The waitress who served us, I never got her name, was a beautiful Korean women and she was so sweet to us! She would always gather out dishes, give us plenty of time to figure out, but wouldn't make us wait too long, and even washed out one of the sake glasses for me to keep as a memory for my Valentine's date!

Don't bother wearing lipstick or any lip moisturizer because you'll just be wiping it off the next bite here LOL.  My go-to order here is their Imperial Rolls and Five Spice Chicken Garlic Noodle. The imperial rolls are fried to perfection, chicken is tender and juicy, and the garlic noodles are chewy, buttery, and garlicky. This place 100% falls in the \"comfort food\" bucket for me! Only qualm I have is that I wish there more vegetables to balance out the meal and not make it feel so heavy. I could definitely use more broccoli on my plate!! I've also tried their pho before and unfortunately, I thought it was just okay and not something I'd order again. Irving St in general has tons of great restaurants specializing in pho (especially as you head down towards 19th ave), so I'd highly recommend elsewhere. The broth wasn't as flavorful here and I didn't love the noodles and the beef.  Perilla is a pretty small restaurant, but every time I've been here, I've never had to wait long and usually get seated pretty quickly. Ambiance is super casual and the employees are really kind and also, efficient! Orders come out pretty quickly, so overall, Perilla is a good and reliable place to count on to grab a tasty meal. :)"

        "Alyanna C.": "First time dining here and the food didn't disappoint. Great neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant in Sunset. Came here after a chilly (but clear) day exploring SF. We were with friends from out of town and wanted to introduce them to a San Francisco treat... hence garlic noodles! LOGISTICS Street parking only - this is Sunset after all. We were able to find parking a few blocks down off the main street, so if you're willing to walk it shouldn't be an issue. Despite coming in on a Saturday night, our group of 4 was seated quickly, maybe waiting at most 15 min for them to clear out. For the most part they were friendly and quick on getting our orders in. They were also very generous on the tea / water refills, so our cup of tea was never half full. Food also came out very quickly after ordering, so good spot for a quick lunch or if you're hangry for dinner and can get a seat. FOOD Spring Rolls: I've had better, but these satisfied the craving. I felt the rice paper + noodles were a little tougher than other places where I've had them. Imperial Rolls: Can't go wrong with the fried variation, and these hit the spot. Very crispy with and refreshing to eat in a lettuce wrap with other fresh veggies. I'd opt for these over the spring rolls, especially if coming from a chilly day. Garlic Noodles: We came here with a goal to try some SF garlic noodles, and Perila met my expectations! Every entree we ordered came with a protein choice and garlic noodles, which are really the star of the show. Slightly oily in a delicious way and very garlicky... but the noodles are thick, chewy, with a slight bounce to them. Definitely not like spaghetti or whatever you get when you order garlic noodles at Cajun shrimp shack in South Bay. The side of broccoli that came with the garlic noodles and protein made a nice veg break too. Pork Chops: If you're looking for best-bang-for-buck protein... I feel like the pork chops were a much bigger portion than just getting grilled pork (at least from looking at my other friends who ordered grilled pork). Plus I imagine they were much juicer, like cooking a whole steak and locking in the juices. Lots of time pork chops are dry, but I feel like Vietnamese restaurants do a really good job with them. The pork chop was very tender and easy to cut into with the knife. Very good to dip into the fish sauce mix that was provided. 5 Spice Chicken: My partner ordered this... and while I really liked my pork chops, I thought this was better. Crispy, juicy, and flavorful... these also paired super well with the noodles. It wasn't as fatty but it didn't compromise on flavor / satisfaction. I usually think chicken dishes are boring, but this was not. It's also a chicken dish I don't see often at the Vietnamese restaurants I go to, so if I ever come back I'm ordering this instead. VALUE For the portions and quality, their garlic noodle plates are a really good deal for the city. I've gotten used to paying $20+ per person for a meal.. so it was refreshing to see entree prices under that. Especially for the quantity - we ended up taking home leftovers. OVERALL Come for the good food and chill vibes. It's not a fancy restaurant with chic decor like so many places are in SF... but you're there for the food, not the atmosphere. And it's good food at great value. Will definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood. Minor note: This place isn't dog friendly as there were no outdoor seating when we visited... however, someone came in with their small dog anyways. One of the staff asked if it was a service dog, the person gave an incredulous look. After some discussion, they allowed the person and their partner to sit in a corner as long as their dog was in their lap, under the table, with a jacket under it. I thought it very strange the dog owner would put their dog through this rather than find a dog friendly restaurant with heated seating (there were options around). I also thought it a little weird the restaurant allowed it - either be dog friendly or don't, our group felt a little uncomfortable knowing there was a dog forcefully hidden under a jacket (it was moving / yelping at times)."

The food was amazing and the portion sizes really surprised us! My bf and I shared two main entrees, the beef vermicelli (plus imperial rolls) and chicken cabbage salad, and we were so full. The food is fresh, flavorful, and filling. Love the sauce they provide, perfect burst of flavor without being too overwhelming.  Nice ambiance, similar to the Haight location! Family owned and unbeatable value and food. Highly recommend :)"

I don't think this is the most authentic viet place, but it hits the spot if you're craving it.  I'd definitely pass on the papaya salad; the flavor and thickness of the ingredients was all pretty wrong. I liked the imperial rolls and pho though!  Service is decent, and ambiance not bad!"

Overall, a welcoming place to get out of the cold for hot pho."

Typical Vietnamese restaurant service but that's not what this type of spot is here for.  Ordered the shrimp rolls and beef vermicelli. My friends ordered garlic noodles with chicken and the chicken vermicelli. Spring rolls are good and fresh. If they had wonton skin in them I would have really enjoyed them!  Beef vermicelli was really good. Fish sauce was also great flavor and it was all well balanced with a good amount of meat, noodles, and veggies. I tried the chicken as well and it was just as good. Nice crispy skin.  Along with the portions, prices are also excellent."

David thanked me for my previous review (so nice) and the service was kind as well. I was with my family of five and we were chose to sit in the main building area (not bar). We did order some appetizers and drinks to start off.  DRINKS: Shirley Temple - So delicious! It tasted so natural. Water APPETIZERS: Palenta - so tasty! It's like fried bread almost. Bread - the bread was so addictive! We had to get a second order in because everyone loved it so much! ENTREES: Spaghetti with Red Sauce - this isn't on the menu, so you have to make a custom order. The red sauce is my favorite here! Fish Stew (I don't remember much else) DESERT: Tiramisu - SO DELICIOUS OMG! By the way the staff celebrated our birthday early as a surprise, so kind!

        "Saketh M.": "Super nice waiters and servers. We had a fresh, fluffy loaf of bread served with olive oil and sundried tomatoes. It was sweet, savory, and perfect dip-- quite the upgrade from oil or salted butter. Next we had penne al sugo with cherry tomatoes and a tomato sauce. It was simple but done so well. It was sweet from the tomatoes, and had a solid flavor and texture from onions and garlic. The portion was reasonably sized. The pasta was cooked well, and I didn't mind that it was gluten free (quinoa) pasta. The gnocchi gorgonzola was also gluten free and was so pillowy. This is something I recommend sharing; it's large! It was creamy and good, very rich. I do wish the gnocchi had some bite but this was a new experience. For dessert we had a panna cotta and a limoncello cake. The panna cotta was so milky and creamy, neither the tartness of the berries or the sweetness of the custard overpowered. The limoncello cake was sweeter, and I enjoyed its simplicity. The frosting was very solid and had a great lemon flavor.  During the main course, we also sampled some little fried polenta cakes. They had polenta, Gorgonzola, and mushrooms, and were cooked, frozen, battered, and fried. When I told you my jaw dropped. These were 10/10 without a doubt and this bite was the highlight of the entire meal. the entire day."

        "Sam L.": "Maybe we came on an off night? Saw the reviews and gave it a try for a late Saturday night dinner, we made a reservation although ended up waiting a bit once they got there so they could set up a table outside. No biggie, maybe weren't expecting us to do so. Then it took 10 minutes to have a heater switched on - again not a huge biggie, but started to feel like inside must have been a little disorganized. Felt the same way after we had two different waiters (second was albeit very friendly), then the bread took a while to get to the table, then the drinks took a while, then the food took a while.... I could see how this would be a sweet neighborhood spot, but I don't live nearby so not sure I'd make another trip out. The drinks were good, the pasta was just okay - not super flavorful, and all of our dishes felt like stuff we could easily make at home. The bread was served coldish and would have been a bit too dense if not for the sauce. We got a salad that at least had good portions, but again, pretty standard. It's a bummer! But again, given all the positive reviews, maybe we went on an off night."

It wasn't heavy but still filled my palate! We also ordered butter pasta which was amazing as well.  When I asked for the bill, the kind waiter brought out panna cotta for us, which we did not order, but said it was on the house. How sweet! Would totally recommend because of the amazing service! To top it off, as they brought the bill over, they only charged me for one of our dish as a bday gift!

The food tastes fresh and authentic. Portions are generous. We liked everything we ordered! We ordered the bone marrow, rigatoni with salsiccia, and whole branzino.

She is a super picky teen when it comes to her alfredo pasta but it passed her requirements. My other teen, ordered the a rigatoni dish with sausage and peas. It was excellent.

I switch off my mains every now and then... but usually end up going back to the seafood pasta. This latest visit was for the truffle pasta - underwhelmed, really. Wasn't what I was hoping for, and it looked a tad bland. Tasted like it too.  But my favorite part (and, again, you gotta sit at the bar and make friends with the bartenders because they're just so sweet) - the limoncello, the fernet, and the dessert.

I really enjoy the ambiance of all the locations I've been to as they all have ample seating for everyone.

        "Cristina S.": "Souvla on Divisadero Street is a welcoming restaurant that looks small from the outside, but it is decently sized with a good amount of seating inside the restaurant (4-6 tables), as well as in the back patio (5-7 tables). The patio is a perfect place to enjoy your meal and there are also light and heaters outside, so that you can enjoy your meal. When you arrive to Souvla, you first order and then find a seat. I wouldn't recommend large groups at this location because there are many tables, however, many of them only seat 4 people and I feel as if it would be quite difficult to find tables to eat together as a group of more than 4. The staff at this location is friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. Souvla is a fresh and healthy greek restaurant. There menu consists of mainly salads and gyros, but they also sell sides such as fries, soup, and vegetables. A unique part of their menu is their fresh greek yogurt.  I love Souvla and I would even consider it one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. I personally love the chicken salad. It has a wide variety of greens (kale and fennel), oranges, pickled red onions, cheese, and rotisserie chicken with their homemade \"granch\" dressing all on top. While it is a large amount of food and a delicious meal, it is priced at $17. The same meal but in the gyro form (wrapped in pita bread) is priced at $16. Although I would never spend that much money on a salad anywhere else, I would recommend this salad to a friend because it is simple and delicious, while being fresh and bursting with flavor. Souvla has a \"greek style\" that you can get on any meal with french fries on top for an additional $1. Although I have never tried this, I am aware that it is very popular here. Another item you cannot skip out on is the Baklava Greek Yogurt. This dessert is simply greek yogurt with honey and baklava. I had never tried baklava prior to Souvla, but it is similar to a granola, however a bit sweeter. It is such a refreshing dessert without being too sugary."

Cause first time I tried souvla and hayes valley and was not a fan....but always wanted to try the froyo.  Weird to say that this is the first time I've had froyo that tastes like actual yogurt. Its one of those things you don't realize til you have the real deal.  Highly recommend with baklava crumbles, the sweetness balances the tartness. Although its kinda steep...$8....I think I'd still prefer boba if ima pay that kind money yaknow?"

        "Erica K.": "It feels like establishments that have made SF into what it is are clearly not the same anymore-case in point, Souvla. We ordered their: Veg Salad Lamb Sandwich Greek Fries The Veg Salad thankfully tasted the same as how I ordered it before, but the Lamb Sandwich seemed less filling and fulfilling in comparison to their salad version. The big disappointment of the night was probably the fries, they looked like Burger King's fries but with garnishes! The real kicker was that it's a $1 up charge for a side of ketchup, which doesn't make sense because when you order online the $1 up charge is nowhere to be found? Even Burger King doesn't charge for their ketchup packets, but nickel and diming like this isn't right. There needs to be more cohesiveness between their online ordering versus IRL."

Highly recommend: pork shoulder + Greek style (with fries) + hot sauce Minus one star because you can't substitute a yogurt dressing for an olive oil (both come with it on the side) without a surcharge.

The fries were so good, I think I would've loved a dipping sauce to go with it, but otherwise they were stellar.  Let's not forget the dessert. Wow wow wow.

Get the BAKLAVA FROYO - sooooooo good. it costs a pretty penny at $8 for a cup, but the froyo is so tart and the baklava is sweet and chewy, making it the perfect snack on a hot summer day. Their wraps and fries are all pretty good too!  This location in particular also has the cutest back patio! Its nice and shaded and has plenty of seating.

Not a lot of space to dine for multiple people, most seating seats two people facing each other or multiples Bar style. My friend was running late so another friend decided to order her food early and had ordered it to-go. She still wanted to eat there with us and as soon as she opened her food they told her she couldn't eat it since it was for to-go! She ordered it already packaged to-go because she knew she wouldn't have been able to finish it so instead of packaging later she decided to just order it to-go. It was an awkward situation since we hadn't planned to not eat there and aren't local to the area so driving to someone else's place wasn't an option. The person who told us we couldnt eat the to-go order there didn't provide us any options either. Just that she could not eat her food there. We didn't want to eat in our car nor did we want our friend to be left waiting for us to eat our food and decided to go somewhere else for our food and eat at that restaurant whom thankfully didn't mind we brought a different meal to. Also for a place that's supposed to be Hawaiian inspired /island inspired food the ambience and energy felt too formal and service was not expected since hawai'i tends to be more chill. I don't know if I'll be back. The food looked really good though and may just need to give it another try!

The unique beers that they offer. My other thoughts: It would've been nice if there were more beer on tap. The fried rice dish was decent. I thought the dish was served with spam, but it was actually Portuguese sausage.

He checked on us very often to make sure we were doing fine and even engaged in some conversations with us- funny guy.  The food... I actually quite enjoyed it. Everything was made fresh and those fish sliders were probabaly my favorite! Fish is so crispy and went well with whatever slaw they had with it.

You need to type in \"Unco Frank's\" in the search bar on the website OK now for the food: The Chicken Teri Plate is really good, large chunks of juicy and tender chicken.  The Mochiko Chicken Plate is even better than the the Teri Chicken. Crispy fried chicken. Juicy and tender; full of flavor. I cannot believe that its Mochi Flour. Da Works Fries - a bit spicy. Love Crinkle fries. The Spam and fries really work well together. The Kalbi plate is decent. Full of flavor; a bit chewy, but that is expected from Kalbi. Now all the meals came with 2 large scoops of white rice. A small side of green salad comes with a sweet creamy dressing. The mac salad is slightly creamy, but pretty peppery . I would have given 5 stars, but due to the difficulty of placing the order knocked them down a star. The food itself is 4.5 stars."

        "Michele C.": "A great hawaiian location with very unique foods! - food recs - We got the Appetizer Platter, Coconut Shrimp, and Chicken Teriyaki.  The appetizer platter was so fun because it's a great way to try all of the different foods. I was a HUGE fan of the chicken and the kimchi fries on the platter. The chicken was was crispy and coated in honey - I'll definitely be getting those next time that I go. The kimchi fries were great too because I love kimchi and I love fries, so putting them together is great. The only thing is that I think the menu said that it came with meat on the fries too, but I didn't see it. The Coconut Shrimp tasted great as well. So crispy and not greasy at all- it actually was kind of refreshing because of the coconut taste. The only thing was that the portion was a bit small, so you'll prob need to order something else on top of it. The Chicken Teriyaki was good as well, but I think that the appetizer platter and coconut shrimp outshine it!  Neither the Coconut Shrimp nor the Chicken Teriyaki comes with sides when you order in person at the restaurant. So, if you want rice or mac and cheese, it'll be an extra charge. I wish that it was more clearly expressed because we were expecting one side to come with it. That's the only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars. (However, if you order through somewhere like Doordash, it will come with sides. I think that this difference is a bit strange in my opinion.) - wait time - Our party of 3 was seated right away around 7pm on a Saturday night! - service - The waitress was so kind and made sure that we were always set.  - atmosphere - I really loved the atmosphere- they have really interesting decorations (they have tiger paintings on one side of the wall and empty wine baskets lining the other side of the wall). The walls are painted black so it gives a kind of mysterious, bar-like vibe.  I also love the architecture of the outside- there's a big window in front where you can also sit and look outside."

I tasted the sweetness of the coconut chips encrusted on the outside of the shrimp. The mini fish sandos were okay-not much flavor. The fries were crispy and krinkle cut which reminded me of the fries you get in a school lunch. The fried rice was okay. It was greasy. What gave it most of the flavor was the sausage. The Mac salad was peppery. Overall, the food was okay. There was a lot of rice and Mac salad so you don't have to order the fried rice or side of Mac salad."

Not sure why this popped up in the algorithm... as was two neighborhood away from where I was. . No problem... I made reservations and headed over. Arrived around 5 min early. Here was where a bit odd... Restaurant empty and server/owner/manager...I don't know his role stood in doorway and it felt like I was being dissuaded from eating dinner there. ... At first we went to a two top table, but since I had precious cargo with me, I moved my party to a three top. Weirdness continues with can't sit at a 3 top, then re-evaluating the empty restaurant says we can eat there because we'll be done before his next reservation.  Food: 4 stars I had the chicken and polenta...I very much enjoyed (A) the polenta was creamy, deliciousness... There where lemon rind also in dish... Great touch! Partner had the steak-which she also thought was delicious! Fries soaked in grease and salad.. Plain mixed greens salad.  I'd say sides could use a little work, but the main attraction (A) Ceviche (B) shrimp and mayo... Cheese, avacado & oil with toast (A) Sangria (B)... Good At the end of the day... The food is good, but the overall experience is lacking... The ambiance is fine, but extremily small space. The server did warm up as the evening progressed and we enjoyed the food...."

The restaurant is small so there isn't much seating. Call in before to make sure you get a spot. They'll easily reserve it for you if they do. The dishes feel so fresh and you don't feel heavy afterwards. You can tell that everything is cooked well. I would come back here a million times and recommend it to all my friends!"

Personally didn't care for the loud bopping music but it's a vibe. Well worth checking out."

Also the other ingredients are good. The girl who served us was super friendly and I remember her from the last time we went. The restaurant is small, but they have some tables outside."

        "Cherylynn N.": "Colombian and Venezuelan restaurant in The Marina...with 4.5 STARS? ( o _ O ) Yea, that's what I thought too but one of the best Korean restaurants in the city (ILCHA) is in The Marina so can't be too quick to judge.  Gotta try it for yourself... In my perpetual search for outdoor dining, I found MaMo on Yelp. They opened several months before the pandemic hit, and are open for takeout, delivery, indoor dining, and outdoor dining.  We made rezzies which weren't needed as we were the only ones there until we finished around 6 pm.  M E N U Colombian and Venezuelan cuisine with a touch of Californian (i.e. avocado burrata and crispy brussels sprouts). Beer, wine, and soju cocktails available. No full liquor license.  F O O D Unfortunately, it seems we went on an off day at MaMo. Nearly everything we tried was bland - I'm not talking salt but the food needed spices and acid.  * Arepitas: Venezuelan Fried Corn Cakes w/ cojita cheese (3 pc-$9): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3J85i7F&s=592aa4741787c6c1eea3560d140040bee6f5a92384573c1034cbf601bcfb2699\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3J85i7F</a> The arepitas are snack-sized corn cakes without any fillings. They were light and crispy, not as doughy as the regular sized arepas. The arepitas were plain so they could use a condiment for dipping.  * Tequeos: Venezuelan Fried Cheesesticks ($12): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3S0bDGv&s=4ee0a61bb34b509fa0d1b3fbd1986b64cdadb086f179fa7ba1e338d1d78dfa13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3S0bDGv</a> The tequeos were disappointing. While the exterior was crispy and flaky, the cheese was like farmer's cheese...dry and crumbly so there was no melty cheese pull. The accompanying guasacaca sauce (think Venezuelan chimichurri) was herbaceous but lacking brightness and acidity.  * Truffle Yuca Fries Mix ($10): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3S0bDGv&s=4ee0a61bb34b509fa0d1b3fbd1986b64cdadb086f179fa7ba1e338d1d78dfa13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3S0bDGv</a> Love yuca frita so we ordered this thinking it was going to be a mix of regular fries and yuca frita. It wasn't. It was a plate of regular french fries with two pieces of yuca frita for \"garnish\". The accompanying truffle aioli was devoid of any earthy truffle flavor.  * Loaded Patacones: Fried Green Plantains w/ shredded pork, salad ($17): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3S76Kvs&s=1365268118ac7472e251fb58033bf28e6714c2da1d78c50ea4f70290754c47fe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3S76Kvs</a> The double-fried plantains were fine - warm, crunchy, and well-seasoned but the pernil, although a tad wet was stringy, dry, and bland. The tomato, avocado, and lettuce salad was ok but needed acid. S E R V I C E Cordial. The server was kind enough to serve me soju by the shot since I don't drink sugary cocktails.  We were the only table there so food arrived promptly.  A M B I A N C E Cozy indoor dining with ample seating in their parklet. They're located on a quiet street so there wasn't much car or pedestrian traffic. P A R K I N G Easy street parking (non-metered). Overall, I wish I had a better experience at MaMo but unfortunately, the food was underwhelming. On the upside, Dateway is down the block for ALL the single ladies (and men)!"

The dishes itself are quite bland in flavor and overall not worth the price and wait."

Drinks: Herbal Mocktail - light and refreshing, tart and lemon forward with a slightly herbaceous note Tropical Mocktail - sweet fruity with notes of passion fruit in a beautiful reddish pink from the hibiscus Food: French Toast Sticks - so good a must order for the table, these were crunchy, deep fried french toast sticks served with pumpkin butter, came with 4 pieces Waygu Beef Tartar - good, beef was tender with bits of parmesan and capers, served with crostini, seasoning was okay wish there was a bit more acid Summer Vegetable Hash - two poached eggs on top of a bed of more fall themed vegetables like potatoes and delicata squash with a bit of arugula and calabrian chili, interesting wish the vegetables had more of a crisp and char Sesame Flatbread - this is served with a smoked salmon mousse, flat bread was tasty and mousse was well seasoned and a nice whipped texture, think I would have preferred slices of smoked salmon but overall good Service was good, servers checked in regularly, water was refilled often no complaints. Overall more of a 3.5. Food was good but other than the French Toast Sticks nothing really blew us away. Decent brunch and love that you can make a reservation.

We dropped in for a snack but ended up trying a few things on the happy hour menu and splurged on the cheese board.  The crane asada tacos were tasty. I had the flor de Jamaica tacos before and those are a must have if it's available. The cheese board was a fancy and filling treat. Wow, didn't miss dairy at all.

We got some cocktails which were delicious! My friend got a the spicy margarita and I got the summer gin drink and they were both excellent.  For food we got the carne asada tacos. These are vegan so they aren't meat but the fake meat alternative was yummy! The texture is obviously not the same as real meat but the flavor was excellent! I loved the hot salsa on the side it added so much flavor.  We also go the wine hibiscus cheesecake which was the standout for me. This was divine and I would come back just for this cheesecake. It was so creamy without it being over indulgent or heavy and the fruits were such a yummy and tart addition to the sweet cheesecake.

Thanks Sam (and the rest of the staff) for being so attentive and kind; the place has such a great atmosphere. The cocktails were great and the vegan food was phenomenal! We aren't vegan but wanted to give the food a try and wowza! Om Sabor did NOT disappoint!! The clam chowder was fantastic - I didn't miss the clams, the mushrooms they used were perfect in texture and the taste was incredible. The skewers, we found out after we ordered, we're just added to the menu today and we're phenomenal!!! Each veggie perfectly cooked and the seasoning was amazing, then topped with furikake?! Perfect combination of flavors. I'll be raving about this place for weeks! Definitely recommend. We'll be back!"

        "Debbie D.": "If you're looking to grab a bite in the Theater district, definitely check out Om Sabor!  Sharing a space with Phonobar, there are limited window seats at the front of the restaurant. If you have a larger party, there are also tables in the back. Luckily, we got there before the rush and managed to grab an intimate table in the front. Once dinner time hit the place was bustling!  It was quite difficult to read the menu under low-lighting, but thankfully we have flashlights on our phones. We ordered the vegan crab cakes, hibiscus tacos, macaroni and cheese, and a slice of blueberry cheesecake. Because it's a bar, we were asked if we wanted to open or close the tab. We closed the tab and paid after ordering.  Our food arrived promptly and everything was beautifully presented. Unfortunately, I only have fuzzy pics due to the low-lighting, but the taste is imbedded in my memory. From the perfectly crispy crab cakes to the rich and comfort of the mac-n-cheese to the not-too-dense blueberry cheesecake, everything was prepared meticulously!  Despite the tacos having microgreens in them, I actually couldn't tell and thoroughly enjoyed it with the sauce. For those who don't regularly eat vegan food, proceed with lower expectations for the crab cakes. They definitely don't have that briny taste that crab has, since they're made of mushrooms, after all! We finished off with the cheesecake, which was made of a tofu base and topped off with a hibiscus reduction. It was my first time eating a tofu cheesecake, and I'm pleased with the result! Unlike other plant-based cheesecakes made from nuts, the tofu created a lighter and easier-to-eat texture.  The overall meal price was expensive for the amount of food, imo. It's probably to be expected in this district. Other than that I'd definitely come by again!"

He's a way tougher sell on food photos. The hibiscus flower tacos were so unique and flavorful and scrumptious that my estranged brother got a text. Now I kinda have to deal with that. Look at how beautifully everything is plated! Even the plating of the chik'n wings made me want to text my HS art teacher and apologize for trying to breeze through her class so that I could focus more on math.

Please note, they don't take reservations and open seating starts when they open at 5 pm. Live music and shows start later on, but this place definitely fills up quickly. You'll have groups scouting your table before you even finish.  There is an extensive cocktail and mocktail menu, there was a red mocktail with cinnamon and hibiscus that was delicious! There is a rotating menu so there is always something fun and new to try. Order tapas style to get a little bit of everything! I've been here a few times and some of my favorites are the carne asada tacos, chicken tinga tostadas, mac and cheese croquettes, and the black sheep slider. Some things worth skipping (in my opinion) are the truffle mac and cheese, furikake crab cakes, and the au gratin."

Wanted to perform a nice date night before seeing a show and Om Sabor was it. Get there early because this place fills up real quickly. Luckily we showed up right after they opened. I'll start the with the fact that I wasn't too impressed with the cocktails, but they did get the job done. I also wasn't impressed with the entree offerings so we went for the small plates for the night. I will say we were not disappointed Mac and Cheese croquettes and the carne asada tacos were absolutely delicious! I would've ordered more if we didn't order so many plates to try. I'm not much of a soup person, but the clam chowder was delicious as well. The black sheep slider (even though my wife raves about it), truffle Mac n cheese, and flautas were all serviceable...not bad but not the best. With that said there were so many other small dishes we had yet to try. The service from our young lady was absolutely amazing. She was running around all night and still provided A+ service. This is a place as a vegan, non vegan, a human being you must try. This is one of my favorite joints now."

I've been meaning to try it out. Seeing their collab with Om Sabor gave the push. We got the ceviche, potato gratin with crispy mushrooms, and vegan lamb burger. The ceviche tostadas were refreshing and a great appetizer. The potato gratin and crispy mushrooms hit the spot and was very filling. The lamb slider was Smokey and very different from the vegan impossible burger you typically can order at restaurants. Highly recommend for vegans/vegetarians and anyone without dietary restrictions."

The soup is thick - Vegan laksa: this is not traditional, def a Californian thing but still delicious imo The rotating menu: - Prawn mee: so delicious and very hard to find in the Bay. Thick noodle , dried version with a bowl of prawn soup on the side. It's very comforting in a cold day. - Black carrot cake (savory) so good. A tad sweeter than what I prefer but still very good - Chili crab: omg the best, quite pricey but it's so worth it if you can't fly to Singapore - Chwee kueh: the radish topping was on point. Very local dish that might have an acquired taste and tbh quite unhealthy  I haven't tried her chicken rice yet but I will soon.

        "Harry L.": "I'll start off the review by saying that Dabao Singapore is a take-out only, reheat pop-up restaurant. With that said, this place is a MUST-VISIT for Singaporean style food. I first found this place on Yelp when looking for Asian food in my area and I found Dabao Singapore. I didn't really know what to expect and had never heard of the restaurant until recently. When I visited the menu online, I found a variety of dishes that looked really, really good - with a nice variety of dishes for a feast-style breakfast, lunch or dinner. I ordered some dishes to share for a meal for 4 which I'll review below. The ordering process was a breeze and I was sent instructions to pick the food up on a Saturday. Come Saturday, I go to the address that I was supposed to pick up the food at and no one was there. To my surprise, I realized that I had missed an email from Emily, the owner of Dabao Singapore, on the morning of my pickup date. I quickly headed over to the secondary location (which was only a 1 minute drive, literally!) and had my food quickly. Emily included VERY detailed instructions on how to reheat the food and all the food was ready within 20 minutes of unpacking the feast. Overall, Dabao Singapore was THE taste of Singapore that I'd been looking for in SF. All the dishes that I'll review below were fantastic on their own, but as a feast style meal, they were incredible together. The food that I bought could've easily fed 5-7 people so we definitely had leftovers afterwards. The menu at the restaurant also updates and changes regularly and Chef Emily takes suggestions from patrons so you absolutely have a say as well in what food you'd like to see! I would ABSOLUTELY recommend getting takeout from Dabao Singapore! Chili Crab Set - 5/5 Oh my god. Yes. The best thing about the chili crab set was the sauce that came with the par-cooked crab. We reheated the sauce and my goodness was it flavor-forward. It was an amazing mixture of chili, crab flavor, ginger, garlic, tomato sauce, etc. You could've even mixed the sauce itself with a bit of water if you didn't want to be hit over the head with the flavor hammer. We loved dipping the man tou included in the sauce. If there were a few more man tou included, that would've taken it over the top but it was such a good dish. Garlic Butter Noodles - 5/5 Portion size - large. Price - so affordable. Flavor - yum. We ended up getting two portions since they were only $8 each! Laksa 5/5 Flavor town. My father-in-law usually finds that the laksa aren't as flavor developed here in the states but Chef Emily's laksa was sooooo good. You can tell that she didn't skimp on any ingredients while developing the concept of the dish, we loved it so much that we wished we had bought a few more."

Recently, I searched my favorite food consolidator and didn't remember the business name but one menu item caught my eye for a future dinner. I ordered the Hainanese chicken rice (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=b9YAPMaNXLdGECBn_hZaXQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q\">yelp.com/user_local_phot</a>) which comes with a broth. Let's just say that this dish alone is the reason for this update... besides my poor memory. Everything disappeared within eight minutes and my meal had me considering licking up the plate. The chicken fat rice was not overly greasy or rich but still had a nice feel and flavor, pairing well with the tender boneless chicken pieces. The only portion that had a bone was the drumette. I poured the soy sauce over the chicken and rice so it would permeate into the rice while alternating dips into the ginger and chili sauces. I definitely will eat this again. Thanks, Dabao, for showing up on my radar again. Looking forwarding to trying more things as my fridge empties out."

It is hard to find good laksa around here. My husband and I really enjoyed the entrees. The desserts were just ok.

You'll pick up the food with detailed instructions on how to heat it up, which makes for a fun \"cooking\" time!  We tried the laksa and char kway teow, which were both delicious. The laksa was rich, spicy, and complex in flavor (almost a bit funky in a good way?). I really liked all the items in it, including the fish ball, shrimp, tofu puff, and egg. The char kway teow was a nice stir fry that subbed the typical blood cockles in it for plump clams instead.

The Laksa was delicious! Super rich and umami broth. Hae Mee was also great, the shrimp paste was on point and the hokkien noodles were a great texture. Hope to try the chili crab soon!"

        "Mario B.": "So, so happy to see Singaporean food in San Francisco! It's a great pop up and I wish Emily, the founder, nothing but the best! Getting the crab requires a bit of work - you have to get on a waitlist, hope you get it, get only a few days notice, and pay through Venmo. If you get lucky and get selected, you go pick it up cold with emailed instructions on how to prepare it which I highly recommend you follow closely. It's very easy and straight forward but does require some prep work before you eat so I wanted to point that out. The 2 crabs I got didn't have their shells cracked so be prepared to be able to do that at home, as well. We had the chili and black pepper crab. In addition to the Dungeness crab and the sauce, they both come with fried mantou. The black pepper crab comes with fewer pieces but it also includes noodles.  The crab being used is very high quality, fresh, and elevated by the sauce it's paired with. The sauces themselves are the real key to the dishes. It's clear Emily and her team spent a long time perfecting the recipes and making sure to source hard to get ingredients to make it happen and keep the flavors consistent. The mantou paired nicely and the noodles for the black pepper crab were extremely flavorful. There is definitely great attention to detail with each dish, as the crab is placed on top of lettuce to absorb any water and the mantou are elevated to be kept dry. Both flavors were amazing but if I had to choose, I'd probably go with the more traditional chili flavor. To top it all off, you can go for the Pandan cake! It's light, fluffy, airy and pairs nicely with the coconut sauce provided. Not to mention it's so hard to find in the area since it requires the juice of Pandanus amaryllifolius leaves. Overall, I'd highly recommend this place to anyone craving Singaporean/SEA food!"

        "Vincent L.": "Super-authentic Singaporean fare that's exactly as I recall it from my own trips to the island city-state. Even if the names of the dishes might sound foreign to those unfamiliar with Singaporean cuisine, if you already enjoy Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian, and/or Indian fare, you'll find that these dishes are literal culinary melting pots of all these traditions that have influenced Singapore. Prices are comparable to mid-range Asian restaurants in the immediate area. You're getting noodle dishes that are stuffed full of seafood and other ingredients.  The laksa, for example, featured thick rice noodles in spiced coconut broth with shrimp, fishball, fish cake, sambal chili sauce, puffed tofu, and egg. All these ingredients made for a delightfully stuffed noodle dish, and, if I heated the broth correctly, it was reduced to a very thick, almost tsukemen-style consistency.  Meanwhile, the hokkien mee didn't have any broth, since it's a stir-fried dish, but it was still packed with ingredients: yellow noodles and rice noodles full of pork belly, squid, shrimp, fishcakes, egg, Chinese chives, chili sauce, and lime. Both dishes had flavor profiles that were very reflective of the region and its influences: hints of sweetness, heat, and spice, plus lots and lots of savoriness. It was all so delicious that I forgot to snap pictures, so if you're viewing this on the Yelp desktop site, I've included screen caps below. If you're viewing this on the Yelp mobile app, you'll be able to see the videos I took.  All in all, a solid, authentic way to sample Singaporean cuisine, especially because there aren't many other Singaporean specialists here in the Bay Area."

My husband had a delicious crab Benedict and had most of his crab stole by our toddler. The hollandaise sauce was not overly buttered and had a nice tartness. He also got the salsa on the side. We were presently surprise that it had a nice kick to it. The crab was the star, griddled and in large chunks and super tasty. I ordered the smoked salmon on a baguette. The portions were pretty generous. You get about 2 half open face baguettes topped with salmon. This was pretty standard. Nothing too special, but the baguette was delicious.  My daughter got the French toast which was delicious.  Super happy with our visit but definitely saw how this place could get super busy on a weekend and decided not to try to fight for a spot on the weekend. FYI - The bathroom is super small. I ended up carrying my large crossover when I went in with my daughter and barely fit."

        "Mito I.": "Quick Summary: - kiosk available to add the name to the waitlist - Really cool and cozy interior - Interior and exterior tables and chairs - Coffee is not sour - Might be difficult to find parking This is a review of a visit I went last fall. Things have passed, photos were left in my phone and finally transferred them over to write a review about it.  The experience was pleasant and we enjoyed the food experience. We arrived to Zazie during brunch hours, and there was a crowd surrounding it. There was no line because the waiting was done on a tablet. We entered our name and walked around a block or so until we received a notification. I like this type of waiting rather than staying in line, so I like this new service. We might have been called later because we specified to sit inside rather than outside.  The staff guided us through the narrow corridor that splits between different seats with the kitchen and bathroom in the middle. The restaurant felt like I was walking through a home during the holiday dinner time. The other side of the seating area was like the back yard with a roof. Lots of heat lamps were placed around, so we weren't cold. The only time this seating area felt like we were outside is the occasional smell of smokers, who smoked nearby. After some discussion, we decided to get a coffee cake with our cakes, and chose the egg Benedict. I really liked the option to have between 1-3 eggs. From my experience, this dish is the heftiest dish. The eggs look small but the sauce is very decadent. We ended up choosing 2 eggs in the dish, mostly or photo purposes (we usually see 2 eggs instead of 1). While it was heavy, we finished our plates clean. The coffee cake was very good too. I love the subtle sweetness of the surface and the crumbly cake. It went well with the coffee."

We wouldn't even have made it in before they closed so we just left. This time, I came on a Thursday at 1pm and only waited about 5 minutes before being seated.  I ordered the sandwich Brigitte and we got a miracle pancake to share. The Brigitte came with eggplant and goat cheese atop focaccia. It was very tasty but towards the end got super soggy and difficult to eat. The miracle pancake flavor rotates, and this time it was a lemon ricotta. It was incredible- literally the softest fluffiest pancake that took no effort to cut into. Definitely the highlight.  Cute neighborhood restaurant with what seemed like lots of locals. The interior is cutely decorated with a little sunroof and yellow walls. The perfect place for a sunny day and brunch. Would definitely revisit."

The wait was an hour when we got there on a Saturday, luckily for us we were meeting up with some friends and ended up using the time to walk around and catch up. Got a couple cups of the hot drinking chocolate, eggs benedict and Pain de Mie french toast and everything was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the custardy texture of the French toast, and the eggs in the benedict were cooked to my liking. They weren't as runny. Prices might appear high at first glance because the restaurant is tip free and the prices shown includes tips in an effort to provide fair wages for the staff. Service was friendly and attentive. Highly recommend to all you brunch lovers."

Ambiance was alright given that it was their outdoor patio. I would've like that instead of the parklet. We got the Monaco Benedicts, which were so good. The hollandaise sauce is perfection.  We also got the French toast with 1 slice, which was the perfect amount.  We topped this off with mimosas- orange and hibiscus. This was my first time in Cole Valley and Zazie's, but definitely not my last.  5/5 service 5/5 food 4/5 ambiance** outdoor parklet"

We sat outside since we had our dog with us- that's another bonus, they are a dog-friendly restaurant. Service was great; they make a point to inform us they pay their employees a living wage and great benefits so tips aren't accepted there. This is another plus! The food was amazing, I must say. I ordered the roasted white Idaho trout. I never would think to pair goat cheese with trout but it worked. I finished every last morsel of it. It came with a side of roasted potatoes and garlic- perfection! My boyfriend ordered croque monsieur which he enjoyed. Oh, and the Mayan Mocha was on point. If you like spice, this definitely makes your mouth tingle with each sip."

Note: Since the restaurant is on the smaller side, there are long wait times especially during the weekends (totally worth it though) so I recommend planning ahead."

        "E K.": "I have had this place bookmarked to try for a long time, and we went in to check it out. We ordered: mezze platter fattoush salad lamb shank pita bread (Samir bread was not available) our bill came to about $72 inc $10 tip. we were kind of shocked at the price, but the cost of food, we were hoping to be pleasantly surprised. All in all, all of the flavors came out to be a bit flat. mezze platter was ok, but the baba ghanoush, hummus was missing something to make it good. I have eaten Fattoush salad in many places, but this one was so vinegary it made the roof of our mouths hurt. There was no balance of olive oil, pomegranate molasses, or herbs to balance out the acid. we politely asked for it to be taken away, because we weren't eating it after the first bite. The lamb shank was (in my mind) a braised slowly-cooked meat, so the meat would be fall- off- the- bone tender, and the flavor would be imparted in the red broth base. The base broth flavor was flat, bland and watery, with no taste of other seasonings standing out. Also the meat needed more time to braise, and needed a searing prior to the braise. The texture of the meat was a bit rubbery, and tasted boiled. We asked the counter for salt, because it needed something. For $31, I was truly disappointed.  My husband was born/raised in Morocco, so we enjoy dining, and cooking at home, arabic fare. I don't recommend ordering the Lamb shank or the Fattoush salad.  We will try Beit Rima again, and order other things on the menu (maybe try the other location to see if it is a different experience)."

        "Tim X.": "Beit Rima is hands down one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in San Francisco. The food is absolutely delicious, the ingredients are fresh, and the flavors are bold and vibrant. Whether you're a fan of classic dishes like hummus, falafel, and kebabs or are in the mood for something more adventurous, like za'atar fries or lamb shank, you won't be disappointed. Don't be fooled by the unassuming exterior of Beit Rima - this restaurant is incredibly popular for a reason. While the interior is small and cozy, the atmosphere is lively and inviting, making it the perfect place to catch up with friends or enjoy a meal with family. The restaurant does tend to get busy during peak hours, so be prepared to wait for a table or take your food to go. Beit Rima operates on a fast-casual model, meaning you'll order at the counter and then find a table to sit at. While the prices are a bit higher than your average Mediterranean joint, the quality of the food and service more than make up for it.  One of the standout dishes at Beit Rima is the Chicken Shish Tawook plate. The meat is tender and juicy, and the spices are perfectly balanced. The portions are also very generous - you'll definitely get your money's worth. If you're in the mood for something a little lighter, try the grilled vegetable plate, which is just as flavorful and satisfying. While the beef entree looked tempting, the portions were a bit smaller than the chicken kebab. That being said, if you're not as hungry or are watching your portions, the beef is definitely worth trying. However, if you're like me and love a hearty meal, stick with the chicken. The Mezze Sampler is great as well. Overall, Beit Rima is a fantastic Mediterranean restaurant that is definitely worth checking out. Whether you're in the neighborhood or are simply craving some delicious food, this should be at the top of your list. The flavors, atmosphere, and service are all top-notch, making it a restaurant you'll want to come back to again and again."

The outdoor seating area is quite nice when the weather is good. Parking is on the street so it depends on your luck. We came on a Saturday and was able to find one. There is a large Safeway market lot across the street so if you need some grocery you might do some shopping and park in their lot.  Overall I'd say it's a 4-star. But we came on a Saturday and it was quite busy; there was only one guy working and he ran around and attended to every table, inside and outside, plus all the take out customers. I added one star because of him. Restaurant workers are often under appreciated and the good ones definitely deserve the recognition."

It's especially special when you have mediterranean cuisine often for years so things tend to blend together and taste similar. Beit Rima somehow managed to create unique flavors.  Their chicken tastes like yakitori had a baby with rotisserie chicken?? I usually prefer beef/lamb over chicken cause chicken can be too bland but I think the chicken was star of the show tonight.

It was between this place and one other place at the time, but the other place had too long of a wait. Not a problem at all. As a matter of fact, I feel lucky that the other place was too long of a wait. I think the move here is to order the cioppino. Super fresh seafood sitting abundantly in a big bowl. I savor every little bit of it. I seriously would come back and back again just for this dish.  The restaurant itself fills, cozy and quiet. This other couple sitting next to my table, started a conversation with me. They were very lovely people and we were commenting on how good the food was.

Greeted by a friendly staff we were quickly seated even though they usually have a bit of a wait. Jessie was our waitress and she couldn't be any friendlier. Helped us with ordering and gave a great recommendation on beverages that complimented our chosen meal. \"Saluti to Jessie\" We started with Miyagi West Coast Oysters....[man were they good], then transitioned to a nice hot steamed artichoke and Crab Cake Appetizers (both phenomenal). Our main dishes were a good helping of Steamed Clams and even a bigger helping of Steamed Black Mussels. The individual broths were remarkable and were quickly absorbed by the garlic bread. As we were devouring the great tasting meal another waiter named Alex constantly checked on us making sure we got everything we needed. Jessie, Alex and all the other staff members truly cared about us in making sure our visit was a memorable one.  I wanted to complement the service as well as the good tasting food we enjoyed at which point I spoke with the manager named Maryann. What a sweetheart, she too was great to talk to and very appreciative of the feedback we provided. She allowed me the opportunity to go into the kitchen to compliment Chef Raul....and the only thing I could say to him was \"Buonissimo\". What a great guy who was clearly working hard in getting orders out but still made time to say hello. All in all, this was great experience and I am glad I didn't let this one slide by.

My friend and I came here early on a thursday night as we know it gets busy, expect a wait when coming later. There are so many things on the menu we wanted to try so we strategize to order small quantity but large variety. Here's the spread we decided on.  - 1/2 order of The anchor special, 6 oysters, 2 prawns, and steamed clams - this is a must order IMO such a great variety. We had a little sampler of the three types of oysters they had. Also tried the Saint Simon oyster for the first time which was fantastic. - 1/2 of a fresh dungeness crab, garlic style. The garlic style is a very similar if not the same broth as is served with the clams which is so good and they add fresh sprigs of thyme in there, umph perfection. This also came with a salad which was fresh and had blanched carrots. - A cup of their clam chowder - very creamy - The garlic cheese bread - yum this went well to sop up the clam juices. This was a perfect amount of food for a couple of hungry adults. Also everyone we interacted with was professional and great. There is also a small outdoor section if you're wanting to dine alfresco. I'd come back for the same exact meal and also to try the mussels!"

The sauce, cheese and all that veggies are 9/10 *Baked Salmon, I would come back just for this. The salmon was perfectly cooked, and the giant butter beans were to die for 1000/10. Service 100/10, highly recommend! CHECK OUT MY INSTAGRAM & TikTok FOR MORE @melshealthybowl."

There were some other guests being kinda obnoxious, and our server spoke up about it, which I deeply respect.  My only complaint is that the place is extremely loud. I couldn't hear my partner from across the table, so we had to be re-seated at the bar so we could sit side-by-side. Perhaps some sound damping would be a good idea."

We went last night and really enjoyed it - the ambiance is cozy, our waiter (love the stache!) was personable, friendly, and efficient), food was great and reasonably priced. BUT...I have a pet peeve that presents itself at 95%+ restaurants. When you go to the trouble of scoring on all those fronts above why do you drop the pan (pun intended) on the washroom? It's not that it was dirty per se but just don't have the cleaning supplies clearly visible! And all the artwork in your dining room? Why not put some in this room too? We'll be back but sure would like to see my feedback executed. Tx."

Every piece of cutlery and plateware was beautiful, which added to the lovely presentation of each dish.  If you want to try everything on the menu, go with this order: Appetizer sampler (so good, especially muhammara and the cheese roll) Lamb souvlaki (loved the flavor) Main course sampler (perfect mix of all the meats and a perfectly seasoned chickpea salad)  End with the perfect baklava and creamy salted caramel gelato for dessert. You can skip the kunefe as well unless you already know you love it. Also can skip on the appetizer Meatballs (too tomato-y for me)."

I have come here a handful of times and I am finally making a solid good review. CHEF & restaurant OWNER COSKUN features delicious high quality CULINARY GREEK-ANATOLIAN food  This Restaurant satisfied all my senses: visually, aesthetically, and my taste buds were blown away with every cocktail, dish, and dessert.  The Lark is the perfect place for date night, parties, large groups, or even a solo dolo dinner to treat yourself. Everything we tried WAS DELICIOUS 10/10: - Mussaka: This was vegetarian, but it was so delicious. As a meat eater I was shocked how flavorful this was and that there was no meat - Beyti - Ketedes - Arnaki Brochettes - Sultani - Octapodaki EVERYTHING FROM THE COCKTAILS TO THE DISHES were all so flavorful, hearty, delicious, on point 10/10 -- each dish and cocktial did not miss. COCKTAILS: - HWY 360 15 - Pimpinella - Wa Penduka - Whipple - Unruly Passenger - Ondas  DESSERTS: - Baklava - Salted Caramel Celato - Kunafe  You must get all 3 desserts -- they were all so delicious and tasty. I promise you will not regret getting all 3!! All the food was created and made with love and you can tell a lot of thought was put into each dish. Staff provided impeccable service and they were so fast with our order. I have no complaints and you have to pass by and see for yourself."

But the the big surprise was when I went to pay and they charged us $56 dollars for the mimosas and a lemonade. I felt like since I am a foreigner they wanted to trick me and play with me.

Glad to see their beverage program including it. At $30 it can be a bit much, but since they're using a Benriach 12 yr, i guess it makes sense. It was surprising how much the clarification toned down the smoky flavor from the Benriach. Nice milk punch to have tried especially using the Rooibos Tea.  Aside from the milk punch, they have an interesting sake selection and a handful of nice japanese whiskies."

        "Edmond T.": "Friends Only is the 10--seat sushi counter of Akiko's in the Nob Hill neighborhood on California Street. It is an amazing omakase Journey, featuring high-quality ingredients from Toyosu Fish Market in Japan and showcasing Chef Lee's dry-aging technique for fish.  We were greeted with a glass of non vintage Bollinger special cuve champagne, which is a nice touch! Cocktails are also spectacular! Last night's dinner offered bites such as katsuo, a cherrywood-smoked skipjack tuna; zuke, a 10-day dry-aged, soy-cured bluefin tuna; a Hokkaido hotate, yummy chawanmushi, with black truffle and duck liver. The tarabagan king crab served in a salad format, and the star of the show is the 2 uni dishes: one in the form of a hand roll and the highest A grade uni nigri. It doesn't come cheap: $300 for the omakase experience with no a la carte option. Chef Lee said he is \"focusing on depth of flavor and texture\" and yes the thoughtful menu showcase just that and delivers!"

        "Madison W.": "Lovely, intimate experience. The location feels like you are in the private kitchen of wizards. Everything runs like clockwork, and there is such an attention to detail. Unlike other omakase venues in SF (so many!!) Only Friends focuses on aged fish. Aged fish you say??? It's delicious, firm and more smoky than fresh.  For our seating I think there were 12 sashimi bites - there were 3 uni. All were good but I couldn't really distinguish one from another.  I love that there are only 10 seats that L around the chef - so there was a lot of conversation and connection. It's expensive but at 2.5 hours start to finish consider it dinner and entertainment.  Highly recommend."

The whole team at Friends Only are amazing from Linda (hostess/waitress) to Carson (bartender). Each dish from Chef Jerry and Weymond were very creative. The menu consisted of 17 courses not including the complimentary champagne and dessert in a 10 seat cozy minimalist setting. We had reservations for the first seating at 5:30pm and finished close to 8:30pm. The entire dining experience was well paced and I didn't feel rushed at all like most omakase experiences. I can't wait to come back next time and try more of the different cocktails and the creative menu!"

        "Colleen L.": "Casual Thursday night dinner, why not. Love, love the intimate and exclusive feel of this omakase experience. Their resy is \"suppose\" to be public now, but not sure how true that is because the chef was also uncertain haha.  I was able to get a resy through connecting with the wonderful Linda. There are two times for reservations each night they are open, 5:30p and 8:30p. I highly recommend the 5:30p since it's about a 3 hr dinner, I'm too old to be having dinner at 8:30 lol.  What's great about their omakase is that it doesn't follow the \"menu\" strictly, it's more served as a guide but you will get surprise dishes throughout which was so nice. The service was excellent, one main chef running the bar with another chef in the back prepping. The waitresses were all so friendly and attentive. They're fast, when water, tea or alchy is low - they'll top you off before you know it.  The decor is very simple, yet elegant with a lot of wood elements. There is only 10 seats, all at the bar for a communal, yet intimate experience.  I can't begin to say which dish was the best, they were all incredibly delicious and creatively executed with each piece getting better and better. I would say the star of the entire night was the caviar and uni tostada...mMmm! There is a good balance of raw fish and hot dishes. The fish quality was A+++, each piece is precisely aged with intentions of drawing the best fattiness, tenderness and flavor.  Their omakase is on the pricier side and I really wish there were a few extra pieces for the price, but they didn't come up short with quality, flavor and delivery. If you're able to get a resy, highly recommend to try them."

        "Claire W.": "Absolutely spectacular! This is a new and exclusive restaurant that hasn't even opened with a reservation system yet. Currently in its second week of service as they do run throughs of their menu and timing. For those of you who have dined at Akikos on Bush St, this restaurant is run by the same incredible guy, Ray, so you already know it's going to be next level. From the moment I walked in, the ambiance and service was second to none. Linda quickly greeted us with a warm smile and took us to our seats, all of the seats here are counter seats so everyone gets a piece of the action. Quade is the one behind the counter having a party while making your drink creations - he's got a fun and contagious energy.  The menu is pre fixe so you don't have to worry about ordering anything. It is all fish based so if you're not a sushi/omakase fan, this isn't for you. But if you are a sushi lover, you will not be disappointed. Each course is so different and so many unique surprises. One of my favorites is the fish with fried scales but medium rare meat. Also love all the various inclusions of uni, the caviar topped chawanmushi - it is all so good! Price point is pricey but on par for a high end sushi spot nowadays. It's not a place I can dine every night at the price (I wish I could though!!). Dinner will cost you $300 per person, and a drink pairing will cost an additional $90 pp. Cocktails were also priced on par at $25 per drink.  Overall, I highly recommend checking this spot out if you can get into it as seats are limited and hard to get into at the moment."

        "Anthony P.": "Wow! I was lucky to secure a seat on 12/28 and found that I wasn't the only solo diner. This is intimate dining with only 10 seats and 2 seatings a night and serves as the R&D arm of Akiko. Everyone at this particular seating was friendly, outgoing, and chill which gave the entire experience a great vibe.  Their cocktail offerings are tasty and dangerous. I ended up ordering 4 cocktails (Friends with Benefits, Cocomelon, Foreign Delegate, and Child's Play) in total with no regrets.  Based on what I've seen on social media since my visit, they seem to make tweaks to the menu often. What you can expect though is a lot of delicious uni, a large variety of aged fish, and a decadent chawanmushi(that night it had snow crab, duck liver, and black truffle) served with pride and flair. These people know what they're doing and they have a lot of fun doing it! If you're looking for a top tier omakase experience with more variety beyond just nigiri sushi, you should book a spot here ASAP."

        "Howard B.": "We came here for a special Valentines weekend dinner. The restaurant was a little difficult to find and once we found it, there was a large curtain hanging over the main entrance. I didn't know that was the restaurant entrance until I noticed people leaving through it. Once we got inside, the restaurant was CRAMPED. They make the most out of the least space for sure!  Once seated, our waitress brought us some fresh bread and butter. We were both hungry, and finished the entire loaf within minutes. The bread was light and airy and tasted good. We ordered some appetizers and dinner, and did not have to wait long for them to arrive to our table. For our appetizers, I ordered the crab ravioli and my wife had the butternut squash soup. I loved the taste and texture of the ravioli. The pasta for the ravioli tasted like wontons and my wife's soup was fragrant and earthy.  We each had the traditional duck confit for dinner, which came with a side of salad and potatoes. The duck leg, for the most part, was juicy and tender minus a small chewy part near the top of the bone. The potatoes were so flavorful and tender, and the saltiness did not bother me even though there was quite a bit of seasoning on them. The salad dressing was a hit, although I wish they included more salad. Overall, it was a delicious and memorable meal.  For dessert, we shared crme brle and enjoyed every bite of it. The inside was light, creamy, and cold. The only disappointment was that we finished it so quickly and wanted more.  The food here was terrific and the service exceptional. Multiple restaurant employees helped us take some pictures, even turning up the lights after they closed to capture the best shots.  We highly recommend this special restaurant for your next occasion or gathering. Fantastic cuisine at affordable prices with excellent service. Thank you, L'Ardoise! We WILL be back!"

The hangar steak was what I would expect from a fairly competent home cook. Fries were great. Food alone was four stars. But the place felt dirty. The heavy drapes that block the breeZe at the front door are filthy. The bathroom is gross. The waiter's apron was ratty. It didn't feel clean. Also, the waiter stood between closely packed tables, so I had a waiter's butt in my face multiple times."

It is cozy, the light fixtures furniture, and service was impeccable.  Food. We ordered 1) Butter lettuce salad with Anchovies - light, delicious, exceptional. The dressing paired well with the saltiness of the anchovies. And the anchovies did not overpower the salad.  2) Escargot. They were very unique and delicious. I have never had them served in a potato, and we LOVED it! The parsley, garlic, and butter was made into a sauce on top of the potato and escargot was remarkably light, yet full of flavor.  3) Ravioles with Tiger Shrimp. Delicious and light. The sauce on top of the ravioles was light and reminded me of lobster bisque (doesn't look like it, but tastes like it).  4) Duck Confit. Best duck confit we have had outside of Les Philosophes in Le Marais in Paris. Thin and crispy skin, with tender meat that flakes and melts in your mouth. The potatoes that accompanied this dish were perfectly crisp, and the ones in the fat/sauce were incredible and just a flavor bomb.  We will be back :) I highly recommend this place."

At first, it was a bit tricky to get inside as there is a huge curtain right as you open the door. However, once you realize that you have to pull the curtain back you make it inside to find a super charming and quaint bistro. Very similar to what you would find in France. The servers were super attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered a bottle of wine, the butternut squash bisque, the fillet mignon, and rack of lambs. All were delicious. The meat was cooked perfectly.

It was perfectly cooked and the sauce paired well. The salad and potatoes that came with the entree were also delicious. The salad was light, not over dressed with the vinaigrette, and fresh greens. The potatoes were buttery but not soggy and love how they were made. The creme brle was also very good, not too sweet, smooth texture, and top was nicely done. Previously we've also had the rib eye special, duck, escargot, and soup and always left very happy and full. The waiters are always on top of everything, friendly, and the place is clean."

        "Elicia Y.": "Great prices, fantastic and warm service, chill Parisian bistro ambiance. An intimate, comfortable and unpretentious space, exactly the vibe I would look for! Located in a safe and quiet neighborhood in Noe Valley near Castro, it seems like they attract many habitual/returning customers. The servers speak French as well, and they are super friendly. Appetizers: 1. Tiger prawn ravioles are a must-try. They serve them individually in small platters to each diner. It somehow reminds me of wontons from Shanghai. 2. The escargot was mediocre: I found the buttery parsley sauce and the potato to be a bit overpowering. Personally appreciate it more au naturel, grilled with simple sea salt and olive oil, but it seems like they were going for a different style here. The Crispy Potato Cup (en Gueusaille) wasn't as crispy as I had expected. Main: 1. Coq Au Vin is a must-get. The meat is so tender it falls apart easily, and the red wine sauce is the perfect complement. The onions made it chef's kiss. Don't worry, potato lovers, it is served with mashed potatoes. 2. Rack of Lamb. Another must-get. I don't know how they managed to pan roast the entire rack so perfectly and evenly. While keeping it tender and well seasoned. Forgive me for saying this but the Pommes Landaises (crispy potato slices) might be better than the ones served in France... Tip: they do get soaked in the sauce, so I'd eat the crispy ones on top and pack the rest to-go to reheat in the oven later so they get crispy again. 3. The Duck Leg Confit didn't live up to my expectations because I was most excited for this dish. I do think it is because of the natural ingredients, like the duck's origin and farming. Still tender and well flavored. The plate also comes with Pommes Landaises. Dessert: get the floating island. Instantly melts in your mouth (Did I even really eat this?). Topped with fresh strawberries and delicious almond slices. Will try the Pan Seared Loch Duart Salmon and Brussels Sprouts salad next time. I usually don't order drinks at restaurants but I'd give the wine list here a try. One of the best Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot I've had, and they don't up the prices as much as other places. If I recall correctly there is a $30 corkage fee so it would not be worth to BYOW. Try to get a reservation if you can! Mom was lucky and found an open slot roughly one week in advance. They have a round of seating at 5/5:30pm and another at 7:30pm."

It paired perfectly with the coconut rice and the crispy shallots. I also appreciated that the bowl had a liberal amount of both greens and rice so it felt healthy but still satisfying.  There is not really space to dine inside here. Just some seating along the wall on a bar. There are a few tables outside if you want to eat there, but those are limited.

Spicy poke: Actually spicy. Combo base included mixed greens and rice. Generous amount of salmon and tuna. Fresh and buttery. Again, tastes VERY delicious. Tteokbokki: Spicy!! Omg the sauce (I taste gochujang) is to die for. And the rice cakes are cooked perfectly -- neither too soft nor too chewy.

It's a really good value with massive portions - I barely made a dent in mine. The blue rice is also super cute. For the Thai tea, it made for an excellent photo but I personally didn't think the shaved ice enhanced the drink from a taste perspective and it was annoying to chip away at it to make the shaved ice all fall in finally. The fried chicken was incredibly fried and super fresh. My friend and I sat outside in the parklet on a fine sunny day. There was a kid sitting at the next table over liked wandering around, and wow the waiter was so nice to her and accommodating - it was quite heartwarming really. Food was a bit on the pricier side even for SF and I was hit with a couple extra charges for the appetizer and entrees I chose on top of the base lunch fee, but I really enjoyed the experience and food and will be back!"

        "Nova L.": "This restaurant is an incredible eye sore with an ambiance that will encourage you to eat faster and leave ASAP. They certainly did put in plenty of effort into the appearance of the space but it feels like it was done with a committee of people who all added one feature, none of it had a unified style and over all it was extremely gaudy. They played dance music, fortunately not too loud, with laser party lights, and filled the place with enough fake flowers to resemble a Disney set for Snow White... and the costume the wait staff wore was certainly cartoon like. It looked like each one wore a cut up piece of grandmas kitchen table cloth in jigsaw puzzle shapes. If two waiters stood next to each other and hugged it could create a matching shape.  The worst were the scented candles that took away my ability to smell the food and triggered my migraines. Even the plates were made of some sort of coated metal, covered in printed flowers... no nice quality China to dine on in here. Then there were the printed photos of food glued onto the beams in the restaurant resembling a cheap diner with marketing for different dishes competing with each other from pole to pole. The place was over staffed yet they all swarmed in the corners of the rooms and did not look up, making it hard to get ahold of them. In short the photos on google maps is not at all what the place looks like. The food was good, nothing terribly memorable but good. The sauce was either premade or canned and could not be customized so if you want it to be less sweet, or less oil, forget it. They also offer additional vegetable but they refused to give me broccoli even though they had it. I got my dish with no tofu, no egg just vegetables and they just would not give me extra broccoli or greens even if I paid for it? The vegetables were not canned but I don't think they were organic either which was the main reason why I chose this place. Some of the meat was organic but the food was definitely not farm to table as the name would suggest.  The one thing that was excellent about this place was the spice level. Most thai restaurants don't offer thai spicy and even when they do it's only medium spicy... Not this place. If you can't handle the heat then get the dressing on the side for the papaya salad, which was delicious. This place will not water down the fire of the original thai spice standards.  In short if your not wanting a trip to Bangkok Disney land get your food to go."

        "Benjamin C.": "This place had been on my radar for a while now... glad to have finally gathered some friends to try it with me! Of course I had to get the pad Thai, I always get pad Thai at Thai restaurants. It was one of the better pad Thais I've had. I appreciated how sweet and flavorful it was. The noodles were a perfect texture!  As much as I loved the pad Thai, the Pannang nua short rib was my favorite. The meat was so tender and literally just slipped right off the bone, couldn't get enough of it!  On the top right corner was the Hat Yai fried chicken, it went great with the curry and blue rice. The roti on top was an awesome addition that brought the dish together. Definitely a fan of Thai curry! All in all it was great, but just a bit pricey"

        "Elicia Y.": "We had such high expectations for this place because of its social media presence, strong recommendations, amazing photos/marketing... but we were left utterly disappointed. The Panang Neua supposedly has the most hype, but even though the ribs were tender, the flavor was not giving. The blue rice was only special for its color and otherwise tasted worse than white rice. The portion sizes were falsely advertised. The second dish we ordered was a seasonal special was not edible ; it is not on the menu anymore. The pork knuckle was extreme dry, we couldn't chew on it. The sauce was sugary water. The only edible part was the boiled egg. The staff was understanding enough to return this dish. We had to find a different restaurant. The decor was okay; they have the same rose wall as Son & Garden for photos. Overall far from its hype."

I also got Pad See Ew and fresh rolls -- they were pretty good We were a large party of about 10 people and the service was pretty good, the food was good, but the aesthetics were definitely my favorite part about coming here (as I expected based on all of the photos I had seen)"

The space is not very large. The food is pretty good though. If you want good Thai food you should come here. Anything on the menu is a good pick. Aside from their ig worthiness though, the price point is very hard to swallow if you want to come here. The service is really good though and there are usually big parties and gatherings. The atmosphere is usually lively. Overall I would say it is a great place to try but hard to justify coming here for what is being offered. You should try once just to see for yourself."

My tom kha soup came in a huge metal bowl with some pink rocks lit up beneath it to keep it warm. Seemed cool but the rocks went out immediately, even after I asked the server to relight, and thus my soup cooled very fast in its metal bowl. Food was solid and a bit too homey for the price, though my friends enjoyed their dishes a lot more."

Came in skeptical cause food that looks that pretty and grammable usually isn't very good.  ... and to an extent, I'd say the skepticism is deserved. Was the food amazing? Eh, it was alright, but definitely does not live up to the hype and the visuals. More show vs substance. Also quite pricey, but that's probably cause you're paying for the aesthetics.  Sat inside and the blue lighting was horrendous imo; hence, the blue-tinted unappealing photos of the good. A wasted opportunity if you ask me - why make instagram worthy food if you're going to bathe it in shitty club lighting.  Overall, nothing about the food was memorable. If you want good Thai food, go elsewhere. If you want pretty overpriced good for the gram, then check out Farmhouse. You won't be blown away by the food, but the aesthetics of the food and the place would at least somewhat entertain you."

        "Jennifer R.": "Hodala in San Francisco is a Taiwanese culinary gem that serves up comforting and delicious dishes that will transport your taste buds to the streets of Taiwan. I recently dined at Hodala and indulged in a feast of Taiwanese favorites, including Taiwanese sausage, popcorn chicken, Taiwanese buns, beef noodle soup, and braised cabbage, and it was a culinary experience that left me craving for more. Starting with the Taiwanese sausage, it was a flavor explosion in my mouth. The sausage was juicy, with a hint of sweetness and a satisfying snap. The accompanying garlic sauce added a burst of savory umami, creating a perfect balance of flavors. The popcorn chicken, another Taiwanese street food favorite, was crispy and succulent, with a flavorful marinade that made it addictive and hard to resist. The seasoning was spot on, with just the right amount of spices that elevated the dish to a whole new level. The Taiwanese buns at Hodala were a standout. The soft and fluffy buns were filled with succulent and flavorful meat, creating a harmonious combination of textures and flavors. Whether it was the tender pork belly or the savory braised beef, each bite was a delight to the senses. The beef noodle soup, a classic Taiwanese dish, was a bowl of pure comfort. The rich and robust broth was packed with umami flavors, and the noodles were chewy and perfectly cooked. The tender beef slices added a satisfying meaty goodness to the dish. The braised cabbage was a surprising and delicious side dish. The cabbage was cooked to perfection, retaining its natural sweetness while absorbing the flavors of the braising liquid. It was tender and flavorful, complementing the other dishes perfectly and adding a refreshing crunch to the meal. The comfort and deliciousness of the food at Hodala were truly outstanding. The flavors were authentic and reminiscent of the street food stalls in Taiwan, and the quality of the ingredients was evident in every dish. The portion sizes were generous, making it perfect for sharing with friends and family. The ambience at Hodala was relaxed and inviting, with modern decor and attentive service. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, providing helpful recommendations and ensuring a pleasant dining experience. In conclusion, Hodala in San Francisco is a must-visit for anyone seeking authentic Taiwanese comfort food. The Taiwanese sausage, popcorn chicken, Taiwanese buns, beef noodle soup, and braised cabbage were all outstanding and left me craving for more. The warm ambience and attentive service added to the overall dining experience. I highly recommend Hodala for a taste of Taiwan in San Francisco. I can't wait to return and indulge in their delicious offerings once again."

        "Aaron W.": "Hodala is a reliable, quick fix for Taiwanese food in San Francisco. The service is relatively quick and the interior has a uniquely vintage and Taiwanese feel to it.  The beef wraps were nicely pan-fried and the beef was surprisingly tender; I only wish it had some cucumber or hoisin sauce. The braised pork over rice was standard and tasted exactly like I expected, and so did the beef noodle soup. The portions were decent, but I would've liked to see some more sides or a larger serving of the meat.  Overall, I thought everything was decent but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to frequent this place."

        "Ricky K.": "I actually was craving Taiwanese food, and I haven't eaten here in quite a while. This is actually quite a good spot if you're craving this type of food and it's a small, simple restaurant as well. We ordered the beef rice bowl, braised beef noodle soup, popcorn chicken, and the green onion pancake. The popcorn chicken has a good crunch to it and it was pretty plump with the meat filling. You also pair it up with the spicy mayo and the mustard they provide for you. The green onion pancake was thin, flaky, and not too oily which I liked!  For the main course, I got the braised beef noodle soup. It was comforting, hearty, and the meat was good too. It wasn't too dry and chewy which is what I'm usually expecting. Lastly, was the beef rice bowl. Honestly, the bowl was so small, and the meat was a little dry, but the taste was okay. Just wish the proportions were a little bigger. And the egg was cold too :(  Overall, this place still tastes the same as I remember for the most part. It's still good and you can get a good variety of your Taiwanese comfort food and snacks here! My only real thing that kinda bothered me was that the beef bowl was small, but it's okay, it's not a deal breaker for me."

        "Lilli L.": "If you know Asian dads, you know that \"Not bad\" is the highest compliment they can offer. And Hodala's Braised Beef Noodle Soup has my very Taiwanese father's stamp of approval (and also my favorite in the city.) The braised beef noodle is fragrant, savory, and ever so slightly spicy for that signature \"hong shao\" flavor. The portion size for the bowl is generous with both noodles and beef, and I usually can make two full meals out of a serving. The noodles also come with a few veggies - bok choy, daikon and carrot. This place has my favorite BNS in the city and highly recommend visiting for the closest taste to home I've been able to find.  On the side, I always get the preserved egg and tofu, which comes with a large pile of pork floss, and a serving of dumplings -- the sauce here is excellent. For the scallion pancakes, note that the restaurant preference leans doughy while I prefer crispy, so remember to ask them for crispier if you're like me.  In the past, I've also gotten the hot grass jelly with red beans and tang yuan (I add boba too!) and highly recommend, but we were too stuffed this time for dessert. Next time for sure!"

        "Julia S.": "My friends and I came here for lunch since there was a long wait for Dragon Beaux across the street, and we saw pretty good reviews here. The store definitely looks unique, with an intimate old-school hole-in-the-wall vibe. Their menu looked pretty extensive with reasonable prices, especially the dessert menu, and it was nice to see that we had the option to get some Taiwan-specific drinks. If you haven't tried Taiwanese beer, I recommend you to try some of the options here, especially if you don't like beer and you like more fruity flavors! I got the Braised Beef Noodle Soup (if I can, I always judge Taiwanese places by their beef noodle soup first), and my friends got the Mix Gua Bao (with pork belly, fried chicken, and BBQ pulled pork) and the Sizzling Whole Squid w/ Noodle. The beef noodle soup was pretty good, with nice and chewy noodles, soft and flavorful beef, and a clean and spicy broth. The pork belly Gua Bao was the best, with a good amount of soft flavorful pork belly. The friend chicken was a bit like a McChicken patty, which was a little disappointing since I thought it would be fried somewhat like popcorn chicken. There wasn't much meat in the BBQ pulled pork one. The sizzling squid had lots of food (I had to help my friend finish it), and it was decent as well. I think there should have been more sauce for the squid head, given how meaty it is. Their service was pretty good, putting out our dishes in reasonable time and refilling our waters without asking. I'm not sure if I would come here specifically again, though it's a decent choice if you want this kind of vibe and you want a short wait!"

        "Jocelyn K.": "The storefront was pretty small (and also had limited seating - probably 3 tables total for dine-in customers), so it probably would've been a place I'd walk past if someone didn't bring me here. We got 3 things, but the main star was the sizzling whole squid with black pepper sauce. I forgot it's exact price, but the portion and flavor was really worth it in my opinion. The squid was tender and juicy, and we even had some leftover between my family of 3. On the other hand, the pork rib soup we got was a bit small for what we were expecting. The flavor was warming and great, but we thought it was pricey for the portion. The last dish was the gua bay which was good, but not anything too crazy that I'd get it again.  Overall, if you're looking for authentic taiwanese food around the area, I'd recommend to give this place a try :)"

        "Kevin S.": "Incredible. This unassuming hole in the wall spot delivered one of the best dinners that I've had in a while.  Based on the Yelp photos that I checked beforehand, I knew that I had to order the braised beef noodle soup and the sizzling surf and turf. Research rarely lets me down. And as I hoped, my research led me right to flavor town. Both entrees were phenomenal.  Hodala knows how to cook the most tender, melty, and juicy beef, as well as delicious, fresh, al dente noodles. The combination of divine, authentic flavors from each plate sent my taste buds into a frenzy. I've also never had an entire squid before. That was also delicious - and fun!  My only complaint is that the beef noodle soup broth was just luke warm, not hot. But the taste-factor was too delicious and over powering to not give Hodala 5 stars.  Bonus: Generous portions, cost-effective prices, quick and attentive service.  Add Hodala to your \"must-try\" list!"

The vibe is so perfect during the day as the warm sunshine beams in and at night with the street lights and candles warmly light up the place (and of course, the wet your lips neon light). I come here with my bf for a nice day out or with my girlfriends to catch up.  Their charcuterie board is simply THE BEST. The meat is so delicate and thinly sliced. The cheeses are so food. Everything they pickle is delicious. I've tried a lot of their plates and none have ever disappointed me.  They once brought over the chicken nuggets SLIGHTLY overdone, and I mean, just a little more golden than usual which I'm all about. The server brought it over and immediately was like \"they slightly a little too over I'm happy to discount these or if you dont want them at all I can get another batch going!\" We quickly stopped him and told him its all good and we appreciate it! They were still so yummy lol.  All in all, this place is perfect for a day date/date night with your boo or to catch up with your friends. Food bomb. Wine + beer, yum. And service is amazing.

Once a staff member finally noticed that we were new, she was very knowledgeable and helped us select an orange wine that wasn't too bitter. We sat for a while, then realized that we needed to go to the bar to close the bill. If I was in the area, I might go back now that I'm familiar with the system, but it's not very welcoming for first timers in my opinion..."

I like ordering a bunch of the smaller menu items to share and everything I've tried so far has been amazing, especially the chicken nuggets which are like Mcdonald's nuggets but elevated!

I don't know if anyone else is always on the hunt for an amazing bfast burrito, but I have to stay this takes the cake for the best I've had in SF. To note, they don't serve coffee and the wait is usually a long time. Tip: grab a coffee en route and come ready for some great people watching.

On the weekends you can get an amazing breakfast burrito from Bodega. I've never had the bacon one, which is usually sold out by the time I walk down there, but that's ok because the chorizo one is *chef's kiss*. This burrito has everything I want: meat, eggs, potatoes, and avocado. Grab an iced latte from Victoria Pastry around the corner and you are set! PS: I had such a good chat with the staff working, they are so sweet. Tips get split between the staff taking orders and the amazing dudes creating these incredible burritos.

Komaaj is a dining experience absolutely everyone MUST try. I couldn't find a way to make reservations online, so I called in and the owner was so kind. I let them know that we wanted a large table for a going-away party and that there'd be 7 of us. They were so sweet and accommodating! When we were late, they were still so welcoming and happy to have us there.  The ambiance and pure vibes of this restaurant was one of the best I've had in San Francisco. It transported me right back to being home and going to Armenian restaurants, with gogoosh and arash playing in the back. I felt right at home.  All of the food we ordered was 11/10 if I had to rate it. I'm pretty sure we ordered everything on the menu, as we were splitting it all family-style. Among the things we got for entrees, there was the vegan anaarbij (BEST thing I've ever tasted), morgheh torsh, and maahi doudi - all delicious although I mostly only ate the vegan item. We also had maast o labou and sumac labneh on the table, and I am not embarrassed to tell y'all that I would have ordered another 3 portions of the sumac labneh. We finished off strong with the chai gole rose and naan berenji cookies and *chefs kiss* it was as amazing as the entire meal.

It was one of the most uncomfortable indoor dining experiences I've ever had because the restaurant was so cold. There was no heat indoors and it had to have been 50 degrees inside. Everyone was wearing heavy coats and the door was wide open so the staff could serve the outdoor guests. One table came, ate, and immediately left.  They were short staffed tonight and the ordering became confusing. They cancelled our order and it took some time for our food to come as we waited in the cold. When it came, all the stews and hot teas couldn't warm us up. All I wanted was to leave to be somewhere more comfortable. Additionally, the sour chicken stew left me with a stomach ache.

Everything had such an interesting and unique flavor to it that you can't find in other dishes.  The cucumber salad and the Naz Khatoun were my favorites from the platter. However, we did find a strand of hair in the sumac labneh... To compensate for it, they gave us 2 extra sumac labnehs as well as cookies and tea for the table. Sour chicken stew was yummy as well, but it didn't stand out to me the same way the platter did. Also, the Saffron and Rose drink was light and refreshing! A good compliment to the meal."

The colorful salads/starters were a great way to start the meal, and we had the Cucumber Salad (Khiaar Dalar) made of chopped Persian cucumbers, radishes, and barberries with a green Dalar dressing (made of herbs) and topped with seeds; and the Naz Khatoun Dip, made of pureed roasted eggplant, walnuts, and pomegranate juice. But my favorite starter was the Beet Yogurt (Maast Labou), a thick, creamy pink-purple puree of red beets, yogurt, labneh, sumac, and herbs, served with crunchy squares of Naan Sangak (whole wheat flatbread) on the side. For our main dishes, the Smoked Trout (Maahi Doudi) was topped with pomegranate molasses and served with Herb Rice (Sabzi Katteh) made with chopped dill, chives, and parsley; but my personal favorite was the roasted Smoked Salmon Belly, served with yogurt sauce and Turmeric Rice (Katteh Zard). Their signature dish was the Sour Chicken Stew (Morghe Torsh), which came with tender roasted chicken thighs in a walnut and herb stew, which had a distinctly sour, herbaceous flavor. Each of the entrees was served with herbs. greens, and slices of raw carrots and radishes on the side, whose bitterness balanced out the other flavors.

The woman who served us made sure we made the best choices according to what we liked, which was so awesome. 100/10 for the staff there! We got a bunch of difference dishes including the Sour Chicken, Sumac Roasted Eggplant, Smoked Salmon Belly and everything was very flavorful and delicious. Their serving size was really good, we even had some leftovers to take home. Definitely worth a try ++"

        "Siddhartha G.": "We quite enjoyed our first foray into Northern Iranian cuisine. Pomegranate-chickpea curry was sweet and spicy, it went really well with the rice. Salmon (mahi) was fantastic as well.  Doogh was a delightful salty yogurt/milk drink, and quite like the lassis we get in the North of India. In fact, the cuisines do have a fair bit in similar, and it's always fascinating to see the words in common between Farsi and Hindi (namak for instance, meaning salt).  It's an unassuming hole-in-the-wall spot which I missed on my first drive past, it just seemed to say 'laundry'. I knew it was authentic seeing the lady chatter away with a neighboring table of (presumably iranian folks) and then bring them out a platter of delicacies. She was also generous and gave me more greens on request."

        "Dorothy L.": "One of the best galbi I've ever eaten in my life. I highly recommend the pre fixed menu if you don't know what to try.  Food: my favorites were the galbi and the ice cream at the end. The galbi was so tender and flavorful and now I don't think any other galbi can compare lol. The ice cream flavors were also super unique and u can try both the strawberry rice wine and sweet corn one instead of just getting one. We selected the soup with noodles and the broth was so flavorful. The mushrooms and egg was good but def overshadowed by the galbi Ambience: the ambience is pretty open space and loud but they have lots of tables for families and bigger parties Service: great service and all the servers were very attentive and knowledgeable"

        "Sarah H.": "Beautiful restaurant, but the food was a bit disappointing. We got the house menu and it came with tons of food! I was exploding by the end. The double cut galbi is supposed to be the highlight of the meal, but it was FAR too fatty to finish. The house made ssamjang was very sweet and lacked depth to its flavor. The egg souffl was just okay.  I was a big fan of the seafood ramen at the end, but overall felt that it was overpriced for the quality and flavor of the food. The service was absolutely wonderful though!"

        "James G.": "This place was great and so worth the hype. It was my birthday, so we got lucky that we were able to snag a spot. We did the tasting course between us since we already had a gift card, which was great. At first, I felt it wouldn't be enough food, but the waitress who was working with us let us know that we'd be fine. I'm glad we listened to her because I thought we had more than our fair share by the end of the evening.  Once you enter the space, which looks unassuming on the outside and says San Ho Won in Korean characters, you're greeted immediately by someone to help you check in and then sit at your table. The environment of the restaurant is super airy, with wooden columns and white walls that make the place feel very clean and yet not stale since there is concrete flooring. A sommelier on staff immediately came over with a nice bottle of Cabernet, which was presented to us. We had two different servers throughout our time there, and they were super attentive to us throughout the process. It was really helpful to have them guide us through as it was my first-time doing a high-class Korean meal. Helpful to have the set-menu and their guidance; otherwise, I would've been lost as I saw some people look lost with the la carte menu.  Onto the food! The food was great - we started with three different types of kimchi, followed by an interesting buckwheat black dumpling that was cut in half, the bubbling egg-custard, grilled mushrooms (not my fave, honestly), two kinds of Korean barbecue - one galbi and one beef neck (so fatty, so good), and we opted for the fresh ramyeon and seafood jeongol. I'm glad we did the ramen, as the other option, fried rice, would've been too filling. Dessert was very simple - corn ice cream, which was nice to have after all that food! Would I come back and check out the rest of the menu? Probably! But I'm glad we could go with a gift card because it was not a cheap date!"

        "Amanda N.": "Wow... is really what I can say. This is deserving of a Michelin star. We ordered a lot of dishes and nothing was disappointing at all. First, the ambience is gorgeous and feels zen. Shoutout to our server, Rachel who was so helpful and patient with our orders. Let's get to the food.. Egg souffl: a must! The ingredients, especially with the anchovy broth? It doesn't sound amazing, but it really is. Try it with the sauce provided too. 5/5 Raw beef with Asian pear: this wasn't my favorite, but I loved the flavors of sweet and savory mixed. 4/5 Hwe muchim: this was a very interesting dish and you really have to use all the ingredients together including the leaf. It's an explosion of flavors in your mouth. 5/5 Complimentary appetizer/ banchan: very delicious! It sets the tone of how your dinner is going to take you on a journey.  Banchan: we ordered every single one and double of each. I love anything crunch, pickely, and this was the cherry on top with all dishes. Order it all! 10/5 Galbi, rib cap, beef neck, and ribs: all cooked to perfection and flavorful. You can taste the marinade of the beef. I like to make a lettuce wrap adding all the sauces together. Be careful, there is some kick to that spice. 5/5 Sweet corn: this was okay. If you like corn get this. 3/5 Spicy chicken tteokbokki: this is a hearty dish with full of spices. It was delicious and I love the chewy texture or rice cakes with chicken. 5/5 Dessert: we ordered everything. My favorite was the dalgona cheesecake which was coffee flavor and it wasn't super sweet. 5/5 Next was the cream puff which also had the soft texture filled with ooozing goodness. 4/5 Lastly both soft serves which I thought was pretty sweet. 3/5 You come here for the service and the taste of this infused Korean inspired dishes."

        "Jenny C.": "This place is honestly incredible. This was my first time at San Ho Won, and also my first time dining at a Michelin star restaurant. My sister had been here before and done the house menu, which apparently is just an incredible amount of food. Our reservation was later in the evening, since we wanted to do cocktails at another nearby bar first- as such, we opted not to do the house menu, and order other things off the regular menu. For four people, we got: 2 egg souffls, sanma pajeon, grilled tteok, kalbi, beef neck filet, and a kimchi soup- then finished off the meal with the brown sugar dessert. This was more than enough food for the 4 of us. Everyone's favorites were the kalbi, the mountain yam/green onion pancake, and the egg souffls. Highly recommend these items as a staple! Overall, the vibe and aesthetic of the restaurant were cozy and relaxing. Love that the interior looks like a modern take on traditional Korean restaurants. We were sat at a booth, and the tall dividing walls made it feel very intimate and cozy. The service was also excellent, and definitely gave that next level of attention that sets them apart. In total our meal came out to about $75 per person, which is extremely reasonable given that this is a Michelin star restaurant. Highly highly recommend."

        "Terence T.": "Firstly the aesthetic of this place is great. Even outside its a very clean white building which stands out in the street Service was extremely friendly and attentive. Clearly explaining the dishes and the menu and the presentation was great too. However, for the food. I have to summarise with \"yea not bad, innit\".  We opted for a la carte so maybe picked some suboptimal choices but overall the food was good but nothing special and so for the price, have given this place 3.  Mackeral was pretty plain, corn was standard, the special of spicy pork belly and squid was pretty small for the price with no notable taste orgasms. Dessert was mid but the galbi and hwe much I'm were very very good. Great profile of tastes for the hwe muchim which you wrap, the galbi was tender, fatty and flavourful. Lovely place but I don't think the taste matches the price point. I'm not in a rush to come back but if I ended up here I know the food will taste good."

        "Yunjing H.": "Booked the pre fixe house menu on Tock a month ago. They open up reservation at 10am on Tock one month before date you want to dine. They also have walk in available and you will have a higher chance of getting it if you show up a little before 5pm when they open. The anticipation was real and the wait was worth it. The grilled meat were amazing - so tendered and juicy and flavorful on its own. I liked them with the raw greens they provided you with and the green onions salad as it balanced out the fat in the meat. Other than the meat I thought the other dishes were good but not the best I've had from other Korean restaurants. Their menu is on the more creative side vs traditional Korean. I thought the egg souffl was a bit too peppery for my taste (the waiter portioned the broth into the eggs for us). The kimchi tofu stew was a bit too salty even when I ate it with the fried rice.  The pre fixe menu was so large we barely finished and we were so full after. You also have the option to take things to go if you can't finish everything. I'll come back next time to try the a la carte menu."

        "Helena H.": "After making the reservation about a month ago, the time finally came today! I visited with my 3 family members to celebrate my brother's birthday. The restaurant is in a nice area with lots of street parking. Upon arrival, we checked in with the hostess and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. We asked if we could sit at a booth, and the hostess was so friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was so beautiful, modern, and clean. I loved the minimalistic decor.  They provided barley tea for the table, and refilled it throughout the dinner. It was a really nice palate cleanser!  For food, my family and I decided to order the house menu. My goodness. Each course was so visually pleasing, well-curated, and most importantly, absolutely delicious. Some stand-out dishes for me were the galbi and the seafood soup. I've had galbi millions of times, but not like this. The pieces were cut so thick, and were tender, juicy, perfectly grilled, and melted in my mouth. I could not believe the amazing taste and exceptional quality of the meat. I've never had anything like it! The seafood tofu soup was so beautiful, comforting, colorful, and flavorful. I loved the chewy noodles. The waitress was so kind and kept refilling the broth, and even brought some to take home with us! The portions were really generous. There were 4 of us, but there was enough food for at least 2-3 more people! We have lots of leftovers to enjoy tomorrow.  The soft serve was excellent and the perfect way to end such a wonderful meal. Since it was my brother's birthday, they brought the dessert with a candle on it. They also took a celebratory Polaroid photo of us and gave it with a small magnet to hang it on our fridge at home. What a cute and thoughtful touch.  I really wanted to mention how great the service was. We were served by several waiters/waitresses, and each one was so genuine, kind, and helpful. Each person gave such nice commentary regarding the food and their preferences/recommendations on how to eat it, and they all went above and beyond to make our dining experience perfect. I have never had service this great in a long time, if ever - seriously!! I was truly blown away by the spectacular food, extraordinary service, and overall amazing experience. I would highly recommend coming here as soon as you can (if you can get a reservation!). It's pricey, but holy moly this is the best restaurant I've ever been to. I absolutely loved it. I will definitely come here as often as I can find a special occasion to celebrate!!"

We went for a friend's birthday, friend was satisfied with the surprise candle and Polaroid photo they provided.  The food was perfect! Beef tongues was my favorite, very chewy and favorable. Recommend to have BBq with Ssam(lettuces) and their homemade sauces. The Yam&pancake was surprisingly yummy, first time trying this combination. Beef Galbi was good too, but a bit greasy. Overall there was nothing to complain."

        "Kaila B.": "Came here for a Birthday, and made a reservation about three weeks in advance. I'm not an adventurous eater, im kind of picky, and Korean food has been one thing I've been nervous to tackle. I took a few shots before coming to dinner so I loosened up and decided I will try everything since it is a Michelin Starred Restaurant, I need to trust! We did the house set menu, it is a really good price for how much food you get. We were worried that it was going to not be enough food since my boyfriend is 6'2\" and 220 lbs, and can eat like a horse, so we ordered the supplemental beef rib cap, but by the 3rd course, we were stuffed and even had leftovers.  When I tell you, this is my Death Row meal, I mean it.  Some favorites that I would order again: 5/5- All the meats, but especially the Short Rib. These boys were, I kid you not, at least 1 in thick. They were perfect- the marinade, the cook on them, and all the assorted condiments and leaves that complimented it so well. They have this green onion salad, it was so fresh and balanced every bite. 4/5- Kimchi Jjigae Pozole- this was a perfect fusion. I love pozole and kimchi individually, so seeing this dish, was exciting. It was a little spicy, but very very good and hearty. I would love eat this during a killer hang over. 5/5- whatever that homemade tofu ban chan that has a sesame oil on top.. hella good The other dishes were just as delicious, I would recommend trying everything they give, as the meal as a whole is perfect. The service was great and to top it off- the TOILET HAS A BIDET. Not that this is a big deal, but the bathroom is dark, and as soon as you enter, the toilet seat lifts up and the bidet lights up and does a little fountain... it was like watching Disney world of color show..."

        "Courtney Y.": "I have been eating at Novy for years off and on since they opened, mostly because I love their outdoor seating and service has always been friendly and efficient. Food is good but had nothing I was blown away from UNTIL TODAY.  I rarely have brunch here but today was with a friend and her dog and Novy was the perfect choice as their outdoor tables are dog friendly and it's a lovely sunny corner. I ordered the salmon Benedict and was absolutely floored by the hollandaise sauce!  Listen, I am not a huge fan of hollandaise. In fact I often get it on the side because it tends to be too bland or unbalanced, too rich or lacking acid. Novy's hollandaise is the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. I could taste just a hint of Tabasco and the richness of quality butter but the citrus was noticeably forward yet not overly acidic and perfectly balanced. Suddenly, the clouds parted, angels sang, and I became a fan of hollandaise. My server was amazing and asked the chef what his recipe is and it turns out he adds lemon AND lime juice to the hollandaise, not just lemon! I think the lime adds more citrus but it's more rounded and less sharp than if you just doubled the lemon. Absolutely changed my entire opinion on hollandaise and raised the bar significantly.  If you go for brunch and love a good benedict, please don't skip the hollandaise and give it a try. The rest of the menu is ok too."

Looking forward to trying that next time. Service was right on. Seating also available outside along the sidewalk. We sat inside at a high top next to the food prep area.

We were seated inside a nice cubby area lined with windows. The menu was captivating, we wanted it all! Being adventurous eaters, we family styled it --ordered six small dishes to share. Every single plate was delicious and beautifully presented. The melding of perfectly selected ingredients came together for each dish. We savored each one.  GRILLED HALLOUMI CHEESE artichoke and date tapenade served with grilled pita bread.

It's a standard brunch restaurant with some dishes that have a mediterranean twist like lamb gyro, lamb burger, etc. I had an omelette with smoked salmon, mushrooms, and goat cheese, and it's one of the best brunch omelettes I've had in the city! The bloody mary was a little underwhelming (too much worcestershire sauce), but I would come back to try the other drink options. Service was excellent."

        "Frank W.": "I recommend Novy. My wife and I went for her birthday. She said she would eat there again. That is the highest praise. To be willing to repeat an event is the best endorsement of the experience. Also, my wife is much wiser than I am. Her standards would not allow as many positive ratings, which may make her both more harsher and more useful. The name of the establishment is based on how the owners referred to the neighborhood when they were growing up there: Noe Valley has been sought after since I knew of the city, especially favoring families where the general sentiments might be otherwise. The proprietors called it Novy. The menu is Greek interpreted through California. You might not guess, except for the menu items given Greek names. We ordered too much, deliberately, to bring home leftovers. That include the halloumi cheese; the spanikopita; the zucchini fritters; and the feta, portobello topped polenta. All were excellent, with enough seasoning for the undiscerning but the needed subtlety for the sensitive. For a main course, we had the salmon pasta (bowtie). It maintained the quality, with the same balance. The waitstaff were so friendly to produce this funny moment. A family next to us were posing for a picture. I realized the one person would be left out, since she was taking the shot. I did not notice she was Caucasian, while those who would be in the picture were South Asian. I offered to help them by taking the photo so they could all be included. But the one who was standing up was a waitress, doing what I thought I was being kind to volunteer. They seemed like they were all together. That might be a comment on the observer of course. In any event, Novy is worthwhile. We had a Greek restaurant we liked in the neighborhood where we live, until the pandemic closed it. This is a worthwhile successor."

We immediately found a table for three and, after looking the menu for a while, we ordered an American breakfast, a lamb gyro and for me the lamb Benedict. My eggs were cooked perfectly and I liked the lamb even though it was already a bit cold when the plate arrived! My friends also enjoyed their plate! Maybe it's not the best Greek I tried, but it was good enough to come back! The ambience was nice, not crowded or loud and that's was perfect for me! Also the service was good, the waiter was very friendly!"

        "Charles B.": "Not sure why I've taken so long to write this review; they've been delighting me for quite a few meals now. This is a modern take on Greek cuisine. There's a definite respect for the past and a definite eye to innovation as well. The result is usually delightful, and even when it doesn't rise to that level, it is still very good and satisfying. Without further ado, here are the dishes I've had the pleasure to enjoy at Novy: Horiatiki salad (5/5): This is my weekday go-to when I want a light meal. A nice mix of tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet peppers, and feta in an intense, but not too intense, vinaigrette. Dependable and utterly satisfying as a lunch. I've had this several times and it is consistently outstanding. Feta polenta (5/5): this is a polenta topped with feta cheese, mushrooms, and walnuts, with a balsamic vinegar sauce. Again this is an absolute delight to eat with the sauce giving a real tang to every bite. I would definitely have this again. Hummus (4.5/5): This is good, solid hummus, not exciting, but at the same time uplifted by the sundried tomato relish that comes with it. The relish makes a nice contrast with the hummus. Both go well with the pita that comes along with it. I might get this now and then. Lamb Bolognese (4 with chili flakes to 4.5 with pepper shaker/5): I've had this one twice, once with just the pepper on the table and once with chili flakes that were thoughtfully offered. I prefer it with just the pepper, but it was good to try it with the chili. Now I know. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and the lamb sauce is hearty. I would definitely keep this dish on my rotation. Moussaka (5/5): While I am not an expert on Greek cuisine, I would guess that this is the closest dish to pure traditional Greek food at this restaurant, at least among the dishes that I have had. Every bite is a bite of absolute deliciousness. Comes with a side salad which alas, is not up to the excitement of the horiatiki, but is still serviceable. I am here for the moussaka, not for the salad, so that's a minor quibble. I will totally come back to this dish. Galaktoboureko (5/5): I struggle to remember the name of this dish. Fortunately it is easily recognized on the menu. I have never encountered this dish anywhere else. I would not have been surprised to learn that they invented this, but no, it is apparently quite traditional. Since I've never seen it anywhere else, I don't know how much they are following tradition and how much they are riffing on it. Whatever they're doing, they're doing it right and I absolutely love this dessert and will return to it in the future. I'm a sucker for places that serve dishes that are not the usual suspects, and this fits the bill royally. Foodies, take notice. Baklava (5/5): This is not your corner store baklava. I am guessing that they make it in-house, it is so different from the baklava that I usually see. Same ingredients but sprawling and moist. This is taking baklava to a whole 'nother level. I would return to this again and again. It may have even spoiled me for baklava, and the corner store variety may never do it for me again. Once more, foodies, take notice. Brioche Bread Pudding (4/5): There is nothing wrong with this dish. There's also nothing unusual about this dish. I'm guessing it's here as a good safe desert choice along with the flourless chocolate cake, which I haven't tried but likely is also perfectly good.  Given the joy I got from the galaktoboureko and the baklava, I may never get to the flourless chocolate cake. At the very least, it will take me a while. I did try the horta (chard) side and it was not to my taste. I'm also not a fries fan, so I may never try the gyros. Service at both lunch and dinner are quite pleasant and efficient. Props to them for making it clear on the menu that there is a 5% San Francisco surcharge. They put a card on the tables showing the night's specials (cioppino on Friday and Saturday nights, which I look forward to trying) with the price so I don't have to ask. They also clearly mark which dishes are subject to a potential health risk from undercooking rather than just putting it as a generic footnote and leaving me to guess what is safe and what is not. Great transparency, which is very pro-customer. Plenty of covered, heated outdoor seating."

The portions are a lot bigger than they look in pictures. I got the gyros with garlic aioli on the side. The garlic aioli was my favorite part. So much flavor! Also, the gyros was plentiful but also thinly sliced in a delicate way. It was a nice texture. I could finish it and ended up with a bit of fries and gyros leftover.  Boyfriend got the Moussaka, which was mor substantial than expected. In the pictures it looks like a tiny portion, but the plate they serve it on is pretty large."

The seating in their parklet is clean. - Great service, all of the waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating.  Lows: - Drinks were a little on the expensive side, which was expected."

        "Krystal T.": "Location/Experience: 10/10 Joined the waitlist on the ipad outside the store, since it was busy enough that the online waitlist was closed. The waitlist predicted a 15-30 minute wait, but we only waited about 20 min before we were seated even though we chose the indoor/bar option. Ordered through a QR code, but a little annoying since you have to put in your credit card and pay before you can put in your order. Food came out pretty fast, ~10 minutes.  Taste: 10/10 I tried the Hinodeya Ramen and the Spicy Miso Ramen, but I thought the house ramen's broth was more flavorful. The Spicy Miso wasn't worth the additional 2 dollars since all the ingredients, except for the broth were the same. The chashu wasn't too fatty, the ramen is my preferred thickness and has a good chew to it, and the egg was soft-boiled to perfection. I love how they put in a lot more bamboo and green onion than most other places, too. I ordered Level 1 spiciness and it was a good level of spiciness to give it some heat and also be able to taste the broth. The broth was pretty oily for my taste, though. Also, the tabera on the table was a perfect addition for an extra crunch and spice. The takoyaki was average, a little crispy on the outside, not too much octopus inside. Value: 10/10 I would definitely come back for the Hinodeya Ramen and it's a good place to take friends who don't eat pork since they have other options. Not super expensive for a ramen place in SF and a super filling meal."

The service was very prompt and friendly. I don't mind that you order and pay first, I think it makes sense being that this place is usually very busy. The restaurant was clean and the food came out fast. Now about the ramen.. I will start by saying there is no such thing as \"perfect ramen\" . The broth here is the best I have had- I got the vegan creamy ramen. Like I said the broth was killer! The noodles were also on point. They were cooked to perfection. The toppings in the ramen were the not so amazing part. The squash was delicious and I added corn which is always corn. The kale was a great idea however it was pretty oily and not that appealing. The mushroom was a bit to big to eat and the tofu was Inari. Inari is good but it's a little sweet, so it was a bit of an odd addition although I ate it up. The spiciness was also accurate and really good. I got a 4. They have another topping on the table that is tasty as well. All in all this place was really good and I'm keen to try it again. Perhaps I'll modify the toppings next time. I love ramen."

        "Theresa A.": "Decent ramen in japantown. Came here for a quick lunch around 2:30pm on a weekday, but not busy so I was seated fairly quickly. Menu is QR code scanned and you order through your phone which is not a bad concept. I order the spicy miso, level 4, it was good amount of heat, but I wish my broth was hotter. I also love my food to be piping hot. I ordered extra chashu because I wanted more meat, and honestly it was not that impressive. The chashu was bland and dry textured.  Overall, the ramen was overly priced."

        "Mimi L.": "I came here after the cherry blossom festival since the line was too long during the festivities. I joined the yep waitlist ahead of time and it was very convenient so I would suggest checking in ahead on yelp if you are going during peak times.  I ordered the creamy vegan ramen and it's unlike any ramen i've had before. It tasted good but wasn't what I was expecting. The broth was light and slightly sweet and it was filled w roasted kale, sweet tofu skin, spinach, and roasted kabocha squash. Overall, this was a good soup and I didn't have any bloating like I sometimes do with other ramen places, so this place most likely uses high quality ingredients. Also, the service was fast. I ordered my ramen from the QR code at the table and it came out quickly and the staff were very nice. But unfortunately, I wasn't expecting a sweet creamy ramen so I wouldn't exactly recommend this place to my friends. But this place is vegan friendly and if you are up to trying ramen with a twist, this place is for you. Also, this place has a miso spicy ramen challenge, but since I'm not very good with spicy food, I didn't attempt that."

        "Dan M.": "Decent Ramen sold here at 1500. The only one perhaps .I ordered the chicken ramen and was surprised as to how elevated a chicken ramen can get . The slices of chicken that formed into a heart was thick and not dry . The boiled egg could be better as it was a bit over cooked. The mushroom was surprisingly good and the broth was ok. The fried chili garlic def brought on a home vibe to the dish which made this whole experience nostalgic. The service was Very good although the guy server forgot to bring out my hot tea. Overall there are better spots nearby but for the time of 1500 this is suffices."

        "Kayla L.": "Came on a busy Saturday evening for dinner when walking nearby. The Yelp waitlist was easy and convenient to use. It was very fast even though I was 12th in place. You order and pay via the QR code at the table that you are sitting. It's really convenient and more efficient for the whole process. I got the shishito pepper for appetiZer and the house ramen with level 1 spice. The other ramen in my party was the clams ramen with level 1 spice. You can add up to level 5-demon spice! I'm not going to try it but I love to see or hear if anyone has attempted and survived! I really love the dashi broth in comparison to all the other ramens around the city. It's a light but delicious umami favor broth. Definitely will recommend you to come try this place if you like ramen."

The food came out so fast. you order and pay through your phone, minimal face to face interaction. I love this because there is no one that's rude to you if you need anything else you can just order on your phone. Great place, great food, great concept."

        "Vivian C.": "If this is what ramen heaven tastes like, then I don't ever want to leave! I would highly recommend the Spicy Miso Ramen. It was a rich, creamy umami broth with a slight heat kick to it for level 0. The egg was perfectly soft-boiled, the ramen was chewy, and the chasu was delicious. The bowl is perfect size if you're pretty hungry. There is an option to customize the heat level and extras to add to your bowl. It's advisable to put your name down on the waitlist as it was pretty packed around 7:30pm on a Saturday. The line moves fairly quickly and there are a ton of shops to browse to pass the time until you're ready to be seated. Your party conveniently orders through the QR code on the table and the service was extremely quick. Was the heartburn worth it? You betcha."

Our family of 2 adults and 1 child had the following: 1) Chicken mole plate - the mole was amazing! 2) Birria tacos - awesome; the meat was so flavorful 3) Chicken taco for my daughter- the grilled chicken was moist and tasty 4) Side of guacamole- fresh and tasty The restaurant is run by Jose and his mom, and they are the only two on staff right now. They were very warm and welcoming. Jose's mom even sent out a complimentary Mexican rice for my 4 year old daughter, which was very thoughtful.

Jose, the owner/chef, is charmingly welcoming and said his recipes are his grandmother's (see his heartwarming story below)! The Hibiscus tea is also refreshingly delicious.  The personal origin story Jose shared was that, as his Mexican grandmother \"Mama Cholita\" (the restaurant's namesake) was dying, she wouldn't eat his food because it wasn't up to snuff. So Jose painstakingly learned how to cook her recipes from scratch and just right just so that she would eat on her deathbed. He learned - and she ate!  Intergenerational love and homemade recipes from scratch.  Eat here! You will not regret a bite. I will be back. Love, love, love. 6/5 stars!"

More on that later BUT I'm always happy to be anyone's foodie guinea pig - just call me! =D Opening in late February is Cocina Mam Cholita in Bernal Heights. They took over the long time Angkor Borei space (two other restaurants opened in the space but only lasted several months each).  Cocina Mam Cholita is a family-owned and operated restaurant (son and mother) that's dedicated to the owner's grandmother. They're open for takeout, delivery, and dine-in, all day for lunch and dinner. No outdoor dining.  M E N U Mexican cuisine using the owner's grandmother's recipes. F O O D * Complimentary Chips & Salsa: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F5ckp4a96&s=e709bec193c5780795a6c04b09f1d59b0b4bf3347d1b96cbb1c50202ef981910\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/5ckp4a96</a> Fresh, thin, and crispy chips served with a spicy red salsa.  * Enmoladas de Pollo: Chicken Mole Enchiladas w/ refried beans, rice, salad ($14.99): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F2ktbxm6p&s=a3977ddc0c38a622e7f285f31c3b43a65108cdc9feb12a62c5715aa7a9397d21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/2ktbxm6p</a> The mole sauce was deliciously rich and velvety, chocolate forward with warming spices. A generous amount was ladled over the chicken enchiladas. The corn tortillas were soft and chewy, soaking up all the saucy goodness. This was my first time having enchiladas with diced grilled chicken. The char added a smoky element which I liked.  The accompanying refried beans were creamy, the rice was tender and well-seasoned, and the crisp shredded iceberg lettuce provided freshness.  * Birria Sample: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F2p98tb2m&s=ceff6f069fd4348fe01c81885efd080c01f30747ad728aaa6eb3be934be70872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/2p98tb2m</a> The owner kindly brought out a sample of the birra that he just made and it was BOMB! It was meltingly soft and tender, and lightly seasoned so you can taste all the natural beefiness. Sometimes I find birria too stringy and/or hella salty but this was perfect in flavor and texture. * Atole Sample The atole is a hot and creamy drink made from hominy with comforting flavors of vanilla and cinnamon. I saved it for dessert; a great sweet ending to lunch.  S E R V I C E The owner, Jos is very hospitable. It's like going to a friend's family home. He's also the chef, server, busboy, and dishwasher. He does it all! During lunch, it was quiet and my food was promptly delivered.  The samples were a welcome surprise and a great idea to get customer feedback during a restaurant's infancy stage. A M B I A N C E Casual and cozy with about 10 tables and several TVs. The space has really brightened up from its Angkor Borei days.  P A R K I N G Street parking is rough but it's the city. Overall, Cocina Mam Cholita serves up delicious food with warm hospitality. Def hit up this new business if you're in the area!"

First of all, I love the vibe so much! The whole vibe of the place is just very colorful. Here is all the stuff I got from here: RANDOM YOGURT DRINK (my siblings ordered) - it tasted very sour and kind of weird to be honest. It tastes like horse milk or yogurt without the sweetening (actually now that I think about it tastes more like horse milk) Falafel - Falafel was delicious. I am part Lebanese, and the fafalel was the best I have ever had. It had such a good texture and taste. Lentil Soup - Lentil soup was okay for the most part, I didn't really like it that much because I didn't realize there was lentils in it (or maybe I'm going crazy). It was still ok and I had a bit of it. Dessert: for dessert I got Bak Lava which is a mediterranean dessert. It tasted delicious and it was one of a kind, tasted homemade!

The babaganoush was smoky. The falafels were a little crispy on the outside. The spanakopita looked like fried egg rolls! The filling was pretty salty-probably from the feta cheese. The L&B wrap wasn't anything special-it definitely needed more flavor. The musakka was basically veggies cooked in tomato sauce-was expecting it to be similar to the Greek dish moussaka. The salmon was tasty. The beyti kabob was saucy-the wrap around the meat got soggy. The baklava was super sweet. The kunefe was good-it wasn't too sweet. The cheese on the inside added a nice flavor."

I ordered the eggplant musakka, which was very flavorful paired with the adequate amount of cheese to not make it overbearing, and a tasty sauce to pour over.  Only mild complaint was that we actually attempted to come here once before, where it ended up being reserved for a private event (but there was no indication/marking of this on their website/yelp page.)

We walked in and experience little to no wait for our party of 2 on a weekend evening; probably the outlier as it was pretty busy yet no line. Service is u b e r fast. They literally bring the dish out within minutes of ordering (how do they do it...). MENTAI CREAM SAUCE UDON: Best eaten mixed. Obscenely rich and savory-- this is such a guilty pleasure meal bc it's just so heavy LOL. The sauce with little bits of roe will absolutely coat everything in sheer umami goodness. Their noodles are thick, perfectly QQ. The cheese really pushes the flavor overboard. It kind of feels like eating the Japanese counterpart to a fettucine alfredo lol I've tried other dishes at Udon Mugizo and they don't hit the same. Definitely stick to the cream sauce udons."

There's usually a minimal line / wait, the servers are friendly and professional, and the food is pretty good and very generous. I also enjoy that it doesn't feel like I'm right up against another table in all directions. The breathing room is lovely!  My go-to order here is the nabeyaki udon, which is like mini udon hotpot - it comes with a poached egg, tempura, chicken, fish cake, mushrooms, etc.! The udon is usually quite bouncy and springy and the amount of toppings means every bite has something to go with it. This time, I also got the takoyaki and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was! Crispy outside and piping hot inside, with plenty of batter ingredients for fragrance and a good topping of bonito. Definitely recommend and might try coming here for appetizers next time!"

Highly recommend to mix everything together in the beginning while the sauce is still hot so that the cheese melts into the sauce, making it even creamier!  Nothing bad to say about the service or ambiance. An absolute banger of a place and would definitely come back."

The restaurant was small but made for warmth, perfect for a hot bowl of udon on a rainy night. The udon here was more gourmet, presented in hot stone pots instead of bowls. The noodles were thick and broth was really rich.The gyoza was interesting, wrapped in some sort of leaf or seaweed (not really sure) and was tempura fried--different but good! Perfect meal to warm you up on a rainy evening, but should probably come in more layers than just a sweatshirt and a tank top."

This gives you the opportunity to check out other fun stores nearby and window shop while you're waiting! I always get their Mentai Cream Sauce Udon--made with fresh, handmade udon and a rich creamy sauce. I feel that traditionally udon is usually in soup so I really appreciate how unique this dish is. For $18.25, they give a massive portion! There's a ton of cream and cheese, so be wary if you are lactose intolerant. Otherwise, this is definitely the best item to order when here."

I prefer their outdoor seating to their indoor seating. They have a big parklet out front with a roof and heat lamps, and each table is partitioned off for privacy. I've eaten outside in the rain with friends, and we stayed warm and completely dry. The downside of their indoor seating is that most tables are communal. It can be tough to have a conversation across the table if you're seated next to a loud-ish group. I like their rotating pizza menu, which is bolstered by a few great staples. I always get the spicy fennel sausage pizza, and when they offer the bartender pizza -- burrata and sausage -- I order that as well. One pizza is filling enough for one very hungry person or two mildly hungry people. Their appetizers are also great. I've tried the crispy cauliflower with capers and the fried brussel sprouts with lemon aioli, and both were very good.  Expect to wait a while for a table on Friday or Saturday night. To trim down the waiting period, get on the Yelp waitlist 10-15 minutes before you arrive."

They also have outdoor seating but we opted to eat inside. That was when I noticed you know what I've been to this restaurant, but not this exact location. How did I know that just by walking in? It's cuz i noticed their seating and their communal tables which I was a fan of. So I knew already that the food was good. We ordered the crab like hush puppy which was yummy. i would def order that again. We ordered 4 pizzas 1 cheese for the kids, the sausage fennel, mushroom and another one I forgot.

        "Amy L.": "So happy that I finally found a restaurant in SF that has good food for a fair price! Everything that I ate was tasty, especially the crab arancini. You could really taste the crab! The arancini was beautiful with its golden brown and crispy outside. We also ordered the bartender pizza. It was okay. Could have used more cheese and I wish the crust was more doughy and less cracker-like. I think I'd try a pasta next time, rather than another pizza. The beet salad was also delicious. The simple and light dressing paired perfectly with the sweet beets. I appreciated having some golden and red beets in the mix! Definitely ask for the chili oil at Delarosa. It was bomb when I paired it with the arancini and pizza!"

        "Catherine L.": "You really can't go wrong with the classics. Delarosa is definitely a San Francisco staple for a casual night owl or a casual date spot. The food is well done and it's served pretty quickly. The service is really great considering the fact that everyone dies in a communal style on Long bunches. It creates a nice ambience because it feels like you're dining with a big community. I personally love getting the margarita pizza because it's just simple, not overly salty, and you get to really taste each of the individual ingredients. The pasta was also really good. It is a little bit on the salty your side, so it pairs nicely with a sweet cocktail. They also have really great appetizers like the burrata toast, and flash fried cauliflower  Price: $ Overall: 9/10 Must get: any of the pizzas or pastas"

I love the classic margarita pizza with burrata and the fungi or spicy fennel pasta."

My favorite was the capricciosa pizza (marinara sauce, prosciutto cotto, artichokes, provolone, wild mushroom) as it has the perfect mix of all my favorite toppings. Crust is crisp, light, and thin so you don't get bloated afterwards, just delighted with flavor."

We got the dried beef and shredded mozzarella sandwich and it was delicious! Totally recommend if you're a bit intimidated by the menu, since this is a Brazilian cafe. We also got the fried egg, bacon, and avocado sandwich. It was good!  We tried the coconut pastry and it was delicious and not overly sweet. Def recommend! This little place was packed but we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering. Everyone was nice and friendly."

We just checked out of our Hotel and we're getting ready to hit the road back to So Cal and orders breakfast ahead of time through Grubhub. We had the breakfast sandwich with eggs and avocado, the bread it was served had the most amazing crunch to it, you must try the hot sauce, but careful, it's very hot. The acai cup was so fresh and the perfect addition to our breakfast. Packed a few Rosca de Coco for the ride home which paired nicely with our coffee."

This spot is amazing, the food is delicious and it's so cute.  We took a bunch of items home- Coxinha, pao de queijo, and some other items the staff recommended to us as well as some passion fruit juice. The passion fruit juice and Coxinha are a must for me whenever I visit.  They also offer frozen items, but we knew we'd be eating these pretty quickly over the week.  When we got back to Sacramento we put some of the items in the oven. I heated them at 450F for about 8 minutes and kept an eye on them. I think an air fryer would do a great job reheating them too.  We stocked up on their hot sauce from a previous visit and it's perfect on their food. It's also really unique with some good heat.  So glad we checked out this location."

They have very long business hours, and have comfortable seating. The staff are super friendly, the coffee is super tasty, and I love the plants and simple white walls. It's a really nice vibe and OMG their chicken Ceasar salad is AMAZING. The Mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce makes their salad so much more filling. I'm forced to go there every week because there are so many quality options. I've never expected a Cafe to have excellent food, they far exceed any expectations. Their Rosca de coco pairs really well with the coffee too! Such an excellent vibe and so happy when I see a local spot that is thriving. It also is meaningful how bright this location is with natural light it makes for such a happy feeling!"

It's either too sweet, not topped with enough fruits, or comes in a to-go plastic container. Cafe De Casa nails it all, the bowl is in an in-house bowl, it's layered with bananas, and if you add almond butter, it comes as an entire layer atop the acai. Skip the granola to make it be less sugary and experience the taste of the berry itself. Can't wait to try the other options on the menu here. The spot seems sustainable, I hope they can move off the plastic straws and utensils to compostable options soon."

For reference, we reserved a table for 2 ~20 mins prior to arrival and were seated promptly.  FOOD - Chicken and Waffle: 10/10 The chicken was juicy and crispy & the waffle had crunchy bits which added a nice texture. The dish came with a side of syrup and sweet chili sauce which tied everything together.  - Kbomb Benny: 9.5/10 This dish looks spicy, however, it was not that spicy at all(I don't have a great spice tolerance)! It was more sweet than spicy. The chicken was sooo flavorful and the salad added a nice refreshing touch. My only critique is that the potatoes were quite lackluster and dry.  - Butterfly Lychee: 6/10 The drink was aesthetic and definitely tasted like lychee but it was just too sweet. I think the drink would be great with less sugar and more lychee bits to bring out the natural sweetness.  SERVICE - Despite being busy, the waiters were attentive and checked in on us. Quick and great service!  PARKING - Might be difficult to find free parking but there were plenty of metered parking spots ($1/hour) in the area."

I still think about it to this day, and the Nova Benny was so different than what I am used to! I thought the smoked salmon and peaches egg would be a little weird but it was delicious.

They even took our order maybe 20-30 minutes before the opening time. I was so grateful & was very excited to show my siblings the great food I ate here last time. Last time, my friend ordered the Lychee Butterfly drink & I really wanted to order it this time. It is such a yummy drink, and when I was paying out, the staff told me they'll void my drink since we waited so long (I should have ordered more drinks, LOL).

        "Amoi H.": "I was craving some chicken and waffles so I decided to check this spot out since it looked so good in the photos. Unfortunately, it looked better than it tasted.  Everything tasted fine at first but once I was full enough to stop eating with my eyes, I realized that the chicken, though perfectly crisp, was lacking in flavor. It had no flavor of its own without the waffle. Adding salt and hot sauce didn't help. That's how I knew for sure, it could have used just a tase bit of seasoning. I understand you don't want the chicken seasoned so much that clashes with waffles and maple syrup but it's should still taste good enough to eat on it's own.  The waffle, however, was good and was perfectly soft and fluffy with a little crisp on the outside.  I got full and had half of my order left but I didn't have an urge to bring the other half home (and that I rarely ever happens. If it's good, I always take the rest home.) That's how unimpressed I was. The chicken & waffles is pretty popular though (I just wouldn't go back there for it) and they likely have other dishes that are good.  However, the service was good and I like their waitlist system (they use Yelp). ;-)"

        "Brandon L.": "I hate to give this tip away because places like this will be even more crowded, but one way to know a place is good is if it averages 4.5 stars on Yelp. A 4-star average can be hit-or-miss but 4.5 is practically guaranteed to be great. That being the case, I expected this place would be great based on the average rating alone, and I was not disappointed. It was an absolutely excellent meal. Everything was just about perfect. Portions were very generous too. 2 entrees and one side could comfortably feed 3 people. If I have only one complaint it's that I think things should be served on separate plates (I don't mind different food touching, but the plate was so packed that a few things inevitably fell off the plate) and the tables for 2 should be a little bigger. Negligible complaints considering how great the food is.  I went with a friend this time but as someone who likes to dine solo often, I wish they had half-portions so I could sample everything pictured again. It was a very well-balanced meal split between two people, but if I'd come back solo I'd definitely be overwhelmed and not get to try as much as I did this time. RESTAURANT OWNER, IF YOU SEE THIS, PLEASE ADD AN OPTION FOR HALF-PORTIONS."

THE FOOD * Coffee - 1 stars I didn't have this, but my partner called this airplane quality coffee. You do get free refills. * Four Chairs Benny ($22) - 3 stars The thick bacon, runny eggs, and sauce were tasty, 4 stars for these. But the potatoes were dry and the salad overly simplistic (the ingredients similar in quality to what you might find in a buffet style salad bar).  * Crispy Chicken Burger ($16) - 3 stars Breading was thick, the spicy aioli good. Otherwise, this was lackluster. The bun and chicken were mushy, the toppings boring, and usually fried chicken burgers do better with a zesty sauce."

I got the sucuk (Turkish sausage) with potatos and a side of the ricotta stuffed French toast, and my partner got the Alaskan Benedict with potatoes  The sausage had a decent flavor but was tough to chew, the potatoes were pretty bland, and the ricotta stuffed French toast was basically just French toast since there was barely ricotta filling and it didn't taste like much? The Alaskan Benedict looked bland and tasted bland with a weak hollandiase and mediocre tasting salmon, there were no special twists or takes that would make them stand out from any other brunch spot  The service was okay after only coming around once for hot water and even then the cup had some sediment (maybe coffee) from before, so honestly you're better off just making brunch at home"

While we requested hot water, the cup it came in was dirty on the inside with brown remnants from the previous beverage it was served in.

So I was delighted when one of my colleagues asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the neighborhood and find something to eat. I never venture far but it was a nice day and I thought why not. As we walked around the Inner Sunset area, we came up on LaLe which is described (by the signage outside) as Mediterranean-Turkish food with a California twist. Okay! A mouthful  I enjoy Mediterranean food but have never tried Turkish so I was down to give it a go. We chose to sit outside where there is ample seating (plenty of indoor seating as well.) Upon looking at the menu, my colleague pointed out to the waiter that there were not many Turkish items listed. He explained that either the former owners or current owners are both Mediterranean and Turkish and the location is in California so tada hence the description. Okay... LOL And the owners own another restaurant which serves French cuisine hence the name of the restaurant.  It was around noon when we went- so we ordered from the brunch menu. I decided to order the veggie hash cause I love a good hash. One of my friends ordered lentil soup and the other ordered hummus and meatball soup. When the food arrived I was pleasantly surprised- the plating was beautiful. However, I noticed my friends lentil soup didn't appear to have any lentils. It was a creamy consistency but we were told this indeed was the lentil soup. And it was light color- creamed lentils perhaps? The hummus had bright colored veggie garnishes of radish and carrot. My hash was fresh veggies of mushroom, cauliflower, carrot and zucchini beautifully browned. Usually I'm good for adding salt for flavor to my food but this didn't need any. It was fresh, light and filling. Less than $10 and affordable.  They did bring out the wrong item for one of my friends and graciously did not add it to the bill so that was a nice surprise.  I'd go back again to try one of the soups. I noticed some reviews calling it a hole in the wall- although we sat outside I didn't get that type of vibe. It seems to have a very casual ambiance about it. And the service was commendable."

I stopped by in the late afternoon/early evening. When I arrived there was only one other patron. I should also add that I visited during their soft opening.  I ordered the fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and fish under water. The Jade Fried Rice had pork, shrimp, eggs and kale. The proteins and fish and chopped up into pieces the same size as the rice. The rice was fluffy and light, not at all greasy or clumpy. You could taste the wok hay in this dish. Excellent!  The sweet and sour chicken was so crispy and light. There was a good balance of sweet and sour in the sauce. The chicken came with onions and bell peppers. I would have preferred if they were cooked one minute longer. It doesn't take exactly like what you may find in typical Chinese restaurants and I chalked that up to them using fresh ingredients to make the sauce. It wasn't gummy or overly sweet.  The fish underwater was filled with fish and vegetables and tasted fresh. The fish was perfectly cooked. I just wish there was more of it in this dish. I took my order to go and waited about 15 minutes.  Overall I enjoyed the food and found it to be elevated Chinese American cooking.

I dined here for lunch and snagged a spot outside on a lovely Sunday early afternoon. You order inside at the register, you get a number placard to place on your table. Good thing their menu is pretty simple because there is no menu billboard. You have to look at the paper menu or online. I opted for the Broccoli and Mushrooms. I also had the chance to eat Fish Under Water. Let's just say the same sauce is used for both dishes as I couldn't taste the difference. The first few bites were great, then later each bite became saltier and saltier. The quality of the ingredients can be tasted, but I wasn't \"wowed\" enough to try this place again. Everything is self-service, but if you need something, many staff members were around to assist. Mamahuhu is a great addition to the neighborhood and definitely caters to the clientele in this area.  #6/2023"

        "Priscilla L.": "This was a hard rating to decide between a 3 or 4 stars. Too bad no 3.5 stars? I am a fan of Panda Express's orange flavor chicken, like who isn't? From their simple one page menu, of course the sweet and sour chicken caught my eye and so I had to order it. Nice clean presentation with nice fresh looking veggies, rice and chicken. Yes this chicken dish can compete with Panda's Express signature Orange flavor chicken. This crunchy batter they use is so crunchy that it surprised me! Wow! I like it.  This restaurant comes right off the heels from famous chef Brandon Jew, Michelin star chef from Mister Jiu's. This time he's going for Americanize Chinese food that uses organically grown local produce and transparently raised animals to be healthier for the Americanize taste buds. The name of restaurant and logo of a half duck floating in the water made me laugh. Chinese translation of restaurant means \"just ok or so so\".  I enjoy the cute animal pictures on the wall doing Yoga around San Francisco. This orange cat fast glance looks like Garfield. LOL! Hey animals must feel their inner zen, to be relaxed so they can eat and have better digestion.  Oh by the way I was able to to find the secret playlist I picked up at the counter which I thought was a bookmark. You can scan that and play music while you eat out doors. This is a small restaurant.  Would I go back? Probably not. But for those who want healthy, non oily, healthy made Americanize Chinese food, and want veggie friendly restaurant, then come here. Most customers are non- Chinese, but there's a line out the door for people ordering food, so this restaurant is specific for certain crowd which matches the neighborhood that it's in. I know they have two other locations in San Francisco's Inner Richmond district and Mill Vally, CA."

We tried a wide variety of dishes and they were all good--the sweet and sour cauliflower was one of the best (lots of fresh pineapple), as was the broccoli beef with mushrooms, the tomato garlic chow mein (not super garlicy, but good), and the Mala YOLO cucumber. Portion sizes were good and prices were reasonalbe ($14-$17). As a vegetarian, I appreciated that everything could be made with either tofu or an alternate to the meat (like mushrooms). Nothing was super spicy, so we asked for extra hot sauce, which was clearly homemade and yummy. We would definitely come back. They were out of the boba soft serve, so we need to try that."

        "Jason K.": "Came on a Tuesday night with a group of four and it wasn't too busy. Servers were really friendly and got us seated immediately. We sat outside in their covered parklet. The parklet looked really nice with lights and heat lamps above, but they weren't able to turn on either for some reason.  We ordered the Kung pao chicken, mapo tofu with pork, chicken sandwich, tomato garlic chow mein, jade fried rice and west lake beef soup. The mapo tofu was my favorite as it had a thick meaty gravy and the perfect amount of spice. We also really enjoyed the beef soup. Everything else was just ok, with the exception of the chow mein as it reminded me too much of spaghetti and jar pasta sauce. One thing that stood out to me was the plastic cups, plates. Almost feels like you're eating off child proof dishes. Was ok to try once, but probably won't be back."

        "Yoojin S.": "When you're wandering around the city and don't know what to eat... izakaya's a pretty good place cause there's a lot of little bites of variety! But this is SF on a Saturday night... so many popular asian restaurants are packed. But surprisingly we called, reserved seats on the drive here, and snagged a table easily on 7PM on a Saturday?! Amazing.  UNI UDON PASTA -- $24 with fresh pieces of creamy sweet uni? Def coming back for this alone!!! I've had a share of uni pastas, but I love their take on it for actually having uni pieces. The rest of the pasta is more of a savory cream sauce, but like I'd rather have the real uni than the blended saucy version. If you wish to have a more uni-infused cream, you could just take it in one bite together! Plus you even have scallops in here! Joy CHICKEN THIGH YAKITORI - $8.5 - another good deal, you get two pieces. Sauce and flavor felt just right - savory, not too salty - and they grilled it juicy. Solid.  SCALLOP w SAIKYO MISO - $9 The miso sauce was pretty interesting. It had a strong sake flavor to it? Interesting. And they give you all the parts of the scallop. Liked it.  BACON MOCHI - $9.5 I honestly just wanted grilled mochi but this was the closest. I took out some bacon since it was just a bit too heavy/salty, but overall great... chewy mochi!"

        "Ashley C.": "Make a reservation if possible. The inside of Izakaya Sozai is small, so there aren't many tables to go around. There's only one large table if you have a party of more than four people. On the plus side, that table was an outlet for charging devices close by. I needed an outlet badly for dinner, so the outlet was appreciated.  Unfortunately the food is nothing special. Honestly, the seafood dishes were significantly better than most of the dishes that are common in Izakayas. Izakaya Sozai would be better off as a casual sushi restaurant than an izakaya. The Hamachi carpaccio and the tuna tartare were the highlights of my dinner. For some reason the Ramen was more expensive than a good portion of the meat dishes. So don't get the Ramen. It's not worth it."

There was no reserved table but luckily a couple was leaving. We were seated next to the door which wouldn't close completely when a customer entered or exited. We ordered & my husband got his okonomiyaki & finished it before I got my chicken thigh skewers and beef tongue skewers. Another disappointment: I thought beef tongue was tender not chewy and chewy and chewy. For our dinner of 1 okonomiyaki, 2 skewers, tofu and 2 beers the total was $70.00! $70.00!! What a ripoff. What a huge disappointment. I read the good reviews and decided to go here. I know I won't go there again. You might have a good time there but I certainly did not. Lesson learned."

And if you question, should I get this the answer is yes just get it. For the skewers definitely get the scallops and the chicken skin and anything chicken they have if they have the broth soup also get that if they have the Uni pasta still you need to get that! This came last after our order and we were stuffed but after one bite of the pasta toit reinvigorated our appetites and it was full of scallops too. The pork was rich and tender."

        "Juanita L.": "This place seems like it's always busy! Good for them! There's indoor and outdoor seating. The first time I came here, I ordered the ramen and it was pretty good. Came here for the ramen again and it was not good... Overall, I'm not in a rush to return and don't think I will anytime soon. It's a bit expensive for the quality and quantity too. **Tonkotsu Ramen** A $17 bowl served with chasu, 1/2 soft boiled egg, green onion, and seaweed. I added on spicy miso ($2) and mushrooms ($1). Was this $20 bowl of ramen worth it? Definitely not. The noodles were also overdone so there's no chewiness...just really soft noodles. The broth is different now and is definitely not tonkotsu. It's like they put some kind of thickening agent in it so you don't actually get that rich and creamy flavor. It was just murky, kinda starchy (bc of whatever thickening agent that was used), and underwhelming.  **Chicken karaage** Served with spicy mayo and fried green peppers. The chicken was juicy (dark meat) but it was too salty so the lemon helped a bit. It was whatever seasoning was sprinkled on top - not the chicken itself. The batter was okay...it didn't stay crispy so eat it fast!"

We loved the consistency of the soup, and how the egg was perfectly cooked. We also got the ramen additions, black garlic oil and the spicy miso paste, and they were good and very big portions. We realized we could have shared some of that amongst ourselves instead of ordering it per person. Next time, I wouldn't get the paste addition unless I was really craving it! Service was great, and everything came out at a good pace!"

The menu changes pretty often so keep that in mind. For two people, an appetizer and 2 pizzas was plenty. We had leftovers to take.

I got the rotating seasonal farm egg pizza -- Farm Egg, English Peas, Pancetta, Mint, Parmigiano ($19). I thought the pepper was a little heavy handed, but I really enjoyed the eggs and breaking the yolk to distribute over the slice. The crust was also flavorful and crispy, and very thin -- the pizza as a whole feels pretty light, and sized for one per person.  I also got the field green salad ($6), which as stated in the description, is literally just some simple mixed greens with a balsamic dressing."

Definitely on the list of some of our favorite pizzas in SF - the crust is incredibly thin. We ordered: - Appetizer special of the day, forgot the name but it was a type of salad with an egg. Quite heavy on the dressing and came with some bacon pieces I believe, also on the saltier side. 3/5 - Finnochio salami pizza - crust held up well since there weren't a lot of sauce, salami was delicious. 5/5 - Spicy San Mariano pizza top with arugula - the overly saucy tomato sauce drenched the crust unfortunately so the center became soggy, however we really liked the slightly spice with the sauce and loved the mascarpone in it. 4/5 Even though the place itself was small, it seemed like they had an efficient system worked out. My wife and I are not big people and barely fit in the booth, can't imagine a taller/larger person sitting where we sat. Overall had a great experience and would come back to try other pies."

Pizzas are smaller than what I'm accustomed to seeing, but priced accordingly (~$18 per) and don't leave you overly full.  Everything here is homemade, no reservations. Pizza dough is good, but prefer it to be a bit chewier - this seemed more crispy.  // Would get again - daily special minestrone: $12: hearty and rich - spicy mascarpone pizza $18: melt in your mouth mascarpone tones down the perfectly spicy tomato - toasted ricotta dessert $9: lightly sweet, crunchy ricotta cake and perfect berry compote  // Would pass - salad $6: nothing special here - margherita pizza $13: nothing to rave home about. Would've liked more basil TLDR: Overall, great small date spot - not good for groups. Fast service and very reasonable prices!"

        "CJ G.": "If you love a thin-crust pizza, Pizzetta 211 is definitely the place for you.  While the menu is limited -- a few staters, five or six pizzettas and a dessert or two -- what you will find are offerings that highlight the best fresh, seasonal, local ingredients that can be found. With fresh organic greens and a simple balsamic vinaigrette, the tasty field green salad ($6.00) was perfect for one person or for two not-too-hungry people to share. While a little messy to eat, the farm egg, bacon, corn, cherry tomato and chive pizzetta topped with chipotle-creme fraiche ($19.00) was redolent with the best flavors of late summer. The classic quattro formaggi pizzetta ($17.00) was enhanced by oven dried Early Girl tomatoes, garlic and herbs: absolutely delicious. Pro Tip: The restaurant is first-come, first served -- no reservations -- so be prepared to wait unless you arrive at, or close to, opening time. Also, the restaurant is designed for smaller parties of two to four people; if you arrive with a group of six or eight, it will be harder to be seated together. In the spirit of a brief menu, the wine and beer choices are limited as well. You should not expect your favorite wine by the glass or your go-to beer, but you can be sure to find something that you will like. If you're looking for a tasty thin-crust pizza in the Richmond District, Pizzetta 211 is the place for you."

I brought my kid to eat pizza on Friday afternoon and there were no people at the restaurant, they don't want to give a seat to us because my wife is not there yet. I asked a waitress would you mind to give a seat to us because our kid was tired and hungry. The waitress said wait let me ask the manager, She didn't explain us anything, she just ignore us. And standing there(nothing to do) I just went to talk to the \"Manager\", I said come on there are no people, would you give us a seat? The manger said they need to follow the policy of the company, if a party is not all there yet they can't serve a table to anyone. I was so upset,  It is not a friendly restaurant.

        "Afshin D.": "*** BEST PIZZA IN TOWN *** This is a classic restaurant that has truly perfected the art of pizza.Hands down it's the best pizza I've had in Bay Area. I've been to this place at least 10 times and I've always left happier than before.  They have a small menu. There are 3-4 fixed pizza options which are your classic ones. Among those, the spicy San Marzano is my favorite. There are also usually 3 pizza options which are seasonal and they change that once a month (or something like that).  I usually go with one of the new options on the menu and I've never been disappointed. Their daily starters is also very seasonal and they change it quite often. The dessert options are also great and they have an okay selection of wine and beer. What else do you want? This place has everything you want from good vibe, to good food and great prices.  Just keep in mind that the place is busy and the host is not the nicest person out there.

The host and the waitress don't cover for each other at all. The host had a lack of enthusiasm and not very social. She really should not be in the service industry. The server is slighter better but felt quite distant. Just polite enough to get by and make sure you know she does not give a crap about you. Overall I don't feel welcomed here at all. I felt cold sitting outside since they only allow maximum three people sitting inside. I have a group of four. I asked them whether they can turn on the gas torch and they told me it is reserved for evening only. I was just speechless. I did see the the neighborhood adore them and they were friendlier and warmer towards their usual customers while a bit cold towards their new customers. I don't understand this place. There are so many good pizzerias in the city. Why should I be treated this way?! I will not visit again so I won't be a bother to them no more."

        "Kat Y.": "After reading all the good reviews on yelp I decided go give this place a try. Ordered 2 dishes that were actually recommended from many of the reviewers. Both take out were quite disappointing and small portion.  1. Garlic noodle with chicken Garlic noodle ? Really ? Cuz it tasted nothing like garlic noodle... And the type of noodle they use reminded me of those Hong Kong style instant noodle King. You can order either tofu or chicken with this dish. I picked chicken which was very dry.  2. Fish chowder noodle soup I am not sure if it is because of take out, maybe Dine in will be a little better? But this definitely does not worth $16 to me. Portion is small and they only give you a 16 oz container of soup, half the size of what other restaurants would normally give for soupy noodle. After I combined the soup with the ingredients in the bowl, everything became so \" thick and saturated\", suck up all the soup, this whole thing here just CANNOT be called a noodle soup anymore. And the taste of it was mild, nothing special. Again I am not sure if dine-in would make a difference. But I won't order any take out for these two again. Overall first time tasting experience did not impress."

My friends and I came here around 7pm on a Friday night and the wait was about 10-15 minutes long since the restaurant was pretty full.  Between the 4 of us, we ordered the Tea Leaf Salad to share. My friends ordered the Garlic Noodles w/ Chicken individually while I ordered the Fish Chowder Noodle Soup.  Tea Leaf Salad: 100% recommend ordering! One of my favorite salads in the world and Inle did it justice. The savory dressing paired with tea leaves, tomatoes, and peanuts makes every bite of lettuce so delicious!  Garlic Noodles: I didn't try this, but my friends weren't huge fans; although it seems to be a favorite among other Yelpers. Their verdict at the end of the night was that the restaurant next door, Perilla, may be better if you're having garlic noodle cravings.  Fish Chowder Noodle Soup: As a soup fan, this was soo comforting and exactly what I needed on a cold SF night! Despite the name of the dish, there's not actually chunks of fish in there. I'm not totally sure how to describe the taste of the broth, but it's like a slightly lighter version of ramen. Would totally order this again! Inle is a smaller restaurant and I love the modern look of the interior. As is the case with most restaurants in SF, it's not the biggest space. Our server was kind, but our waitress did forget some of our dishes amongst the dinner rush. Overall, 4 stars for Inle and glad to see more and more Burmese restaurants opening throughout the city!"

We started off with the paratha and tea leaf salad: the paratha was very warm and flaky but the curry dip was a bit bland, and the tea leaf salad was decent but the worst out of all tea leaf salads I have tried at other Burmese restaurants (it was really oily for some reason). My main was the garlic chicken noodles which had great garlic flavor but was SO OILY. It was not very exciting to eat and reminded me of really cheap instant noodles... the chicken was a bit dry too.

I'd initially wanted to go up the street, but when I saw the sign for a Burmese spot, I was ecstatic. I'm from out of town and this is a cuisine I've wanted to try but never had the opportunity to. It's very clean inside and the music is a tiny bit loud, but on trend for sure. The bathroom was also super clean, which I always appreciate! Tea leaf salad in particular is something I've always wanted to try for the first time. As soon as I took a bite I told my friend \"well, I'll be craving this for a long time as soon as I leave this restaurant.\" I was correct. When I landed back home I immediately started the search for this salad near me, lol. It was beautifully balanced - following \"salt, fat, acid, heat\" rules - and delightfully unique.  The samosa soup was so rich I couldn't finish it, but I would strongly recommend it to anyone else. I loved the textures in the soup and did think it needed more chili, cilantro, and lime, but it's a smart move offering that to customers so they can adjust it themselves - I can appreciate that! It had the flavor of a more heated dal shorva in my opinion, but chunkier. There was so much depth to the broth of the fish chowder... but when it got down to the noodles, which felt a little over cooked, I started to feel disappointed. If it were possible to order just the broth/stock, I would be over the moon. I have never tasted anything like that before so I can't provide an example for how good it was, but I would strongly recommend this dish. And then we were stuffed, so it was time to go. Sadly. I would have tried everything on the menu if i had an unlimited stomach. Prices were reasonable too!"

Service is also friendly and attentive. I'm looking forward to my next visit to try more dishes! :) [Tea Leaf Salad] Tasty salad with lots of different crunchy goodness. It was almost a bit too oily, but I didn't mind because it's not grease. I usually don't eat tomatoes in my salads but they thinly slice them here so it was easy to eat! [Paratha w/ Coconut Curry Dip] Flaky and buttery carbs, yes please! The paratha was crispy and soft, and it was a good portion. The coconut curry dip is on the sweeter side and the curry flavor was pretty mild. I wish the curry came out piping hot! [Burmese Garlic Noodle w/ Chicken] I forgot to ask for extra garlic so there wasn't enough garlic for me haha. This is made with flat egg noodles and tossed in a soy sauce + garli oil concoction. The noodles were cooked perfectly (not too soft and still had a chew to it) and overall, paired well with the well-marinated chicken. The dish came with a red dipping sauce and I would describe the taste as the baby of ketchup and sriracha.  [Chicken Curry w/ Rice] The curry has tender pieces of chicken and potatoes. There's two large chunks of chicken (super easy to cut with the serving spoon) and 2-3 chunks of potatoes. The curry flavor was mild and I'm not sure if that's the Burmese style or if it's just this place. In general, I do prefer a stronger curry flavor, and more spice. It could have been served hotter as well. While this wasn't terrible, I probably wouldn't order it again. Definitely come try this place out! :)"

        "Poppy P.": "SOOOOOO GOOODDD GODDAMN WHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG TO COME TRY THIS PLACE  Everything was 10/10,, service, ambiance, and moSt importantly, the food.  Came with a friend, and after looking through many many pics and reviews and asking the server and hostess, decided on the Bun Cha and lemon grass clams. Sadly they did not have the pandan desert but it is alright because I WILL be back.  The clams were perfectly cooked- sweet, fresh, and tender, and the lemon grass/chili/pineapple broth it came with complimented that perfectly, and added a nice refreshing peppery heat. I drank this from the bowl LOL. It also came w a fish sauce/chili/garlic/kumquat sauce that was delicious... I am not normally a sweet in my savory kinda gal bc I feel a lot of restaurants over so the sweetness but wow this was 10000/10. I did ask for fish sauce on the side haha but out of personal preference and j wanted to see how it would be like with a lil extra funky saltiness.  Bun Cha- we both did not expect to like this as much as we did. Holy moly the meatballs were deeply savory, juicy, tender, and seasoned to perfection. Not overpowering fatty, and the chewier (in an AMAZING WAY) slices of grilled meat it came with provided a nice textural contrast. Ugh I am still thinking of this dish. It was served in a bowl with some broth/sauce which melded with the meat juices perfectly, and had some bits of charred/grilled onion and carrots. The bun cha was served with rice noodles and an assortment of greens (basil/perilla/butter lettuce when we went) that provided a perfect vessel for the very concentrated savory flavors of the meats; this was the first dish in a while where I actually really really enjoyed having stronger herbal come through, kinda similar to some Thai and Lao dishes where you eat herbs/raw garlic/ginger/shallots to compliment heavier saltier flavors.  Service was great, I enjoyed talking to the hostess and waiters and asking for what they recommended. Every single person genuinely said everything on the menu was great, which was already a really good sign. Ambiance is perfect for a nicer (but still casual bc SF haha) dinner, or a date night. I hope to come back again SOON, and was recommended to try the money trees drink which another customer told me about and also said it was the owner's favorite, alongside their beef carpaccio and another dish I forgot sigh.  Great experience w great food, a new favorite for me fs."

Full bar with specialty cocktails add to the attraction and definitely a welcome oasis amongst the scruffiness that is the tenderloin /union square border.  Would just caution people to take a look at the prices before you commit. Appetizers are in the $15-20 range and mains can go north of $40"

The lunch menu selection was limited but I was told the dinner menu is a little more extensive. The lunch meal was ok. There wasn't anything I would fawn over but the Vietnamese coffee was really good. Just wished it came in a bigger glass.  It a nice place to come and then stroll around Union Square after (esp. with the 4 hour parking). Hopefully we can come for dinner one night and see if it makes a difference."

Nothing was bad; it just wasn't great for the price you were paying and the small portions you were getting. The best dishes of the night were the beef carpaccio and shrimp pancake starters. Both were delicious and the beef was a good portion size. We got the whole fish and it was rather dry and bland, so were the garlic noodles. Overall, it's a nice special occasion restaurant but if you're trying to satisfy Vietnamese food cravings, you're better off at a hole in the wall restaurant"

        "Imee V.": "The most divine and memorable feast experience amongst five friends. The 10 -12 course meal is a must order when dining at Bodega.  Each dish was thoughtfully prepared and presented (tapas style) from the cocktails, oysters, deconstructed pho, carpaccio, their twist on banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe) with caviar, poultry, fish, shrimp and pandan coconut lychee dessert. I may be missing a few entrees, so be do to take a peek at the photos below. We topped the night off with shots of sweetened coffee.  The dishes were fun to share and taste. Be sure to bring a hearty appetite and good company!  Tip: Parking can be tricky and expensive in the area. Do carpool with friends (lot nearby under $25 or less), or hotel Omni - over $35 for 2 hours +."

So many different flavors! And the portions were huge. This is not a place I'd ordinarily go to but genuinely enjoyed the experience!"

        "Nora C.": "Limoncello Ratings: 4.7/5  Food: 5/5 - Limoncello has been on my list for a very long time and was able to try it with my sister. This is the epitome of a great sandwich, and without a doubt we loved it. I cannot wait to go back again! Please read the descriptions below or check out my IG page (noraeatsgood) for more fun content!  - The Mafioso [GET]: This is a BOMB sandwich with fresh and high-quality ingredients shipped from Italy. It's so flavorful, tangy, acidic, zesty, and packed with different textures too. My favorite was the part with the bacon; it's thick and chewy, pairs perfectly with the other deli meats, especially the prosciutto and mixed greens. I added roasted eggplants as well, amazing and delicious. Dutch Crunch was nicely toasted to a crunchy perfection and so tasty. The sweetness from the dinner roll compliments so well with the savory from the meats, and that crunch on the top, literally the crunchiest crunch you could imagine.  Ambiance: 4.75/5 - I love the interior! It is located in an Italian grocery store that sells a variety of Italian goods... pastas, deli meats, sweets, and even gelatos. There's a plenty of seats available, highchairs and tops available to enjoy the sandwich right on the spot. Interior decor got an Italian vibe with lovely backdrop music, and super clean. I would eat here all the time!  Price: 4.5/5 - The sandwich was around $17 after taxes, and this might sound a bit expensive, but trust me that the sandwich was huge and filled with generous portions. My sister and I share half of the sandwich and was completely satisfied.  Service: 4.5/5 - I ordered my sandwich through GrubHub, and the process was smooth and easy. I wanted Dutch Crunch bread and was able to request it in-person and the staff was friendly and changed it for me anyways. They are nice and one of the kindest people out there. Sandwich took like only 5-10 minutes to make, quick and fast!  BLUF: Limoncello lives up the hype for the high ratings and more. It got everything you could imagined from an Italian deli shop. I love the fresh ingredients and all the flavors each sandwich provides. I am literally obsessed with that place, and I cannot wait to return to try more of their sandwiches! Lastly, the pro tip is to get the Dutch Crunch bread, it is so FIRE, especially if you haven't tried it before."

I also got some desserts for us to try.  Everything was fresh and delicious. Portions are generous. My sandwich was so big that I ended up saving half for later.  There isn't really a sit down area. By the deli there is a counter top but it seemed like most folks were taking their food and heading out. It's a quick service style place. You order at the register and then they will call out your order when it's done.  The vibe is cute inside though. Packed to the brim with Italian goods. Worth it if you're in the SF area."

For my first time I got the goodfella sandwich with spicy spread as it seems to be the most popular option here. First of all, they PACK the sandwich with meat. This thing is huge and a good price for what it is. We forgot to add the spicy spread hand asked for it when they were making it. Good thing we did because the sandwich is overall pretty dry. Having spread really helped moisten the bread. The Sandwich itself is really good with lots of flavor but I think I prefer hot sandwiches more. If you want a good cold sandwich this place is definitely one of the best with the amount of meat that is given and the flavors that are packed in. I would definitely love to come back to try their other sandwiches as well."

It's fun to browse around and they have some pretty unique drinks, desserts, ingredients, etc.  I got the Milanese Sandwich ($14.95), which had such fresh ingredients that paired well with the pesto. My sister made a fair comment that the sandwiches here are very bite-able. You never accidentally pull any large pieces of ingredients out when you take a bite since they just slice so well. I also had some of the Toscano Sandwich ($14.95), which was also delicious. These sandwiches are also HUGE, you can easily save half for another meal. I would definitely come back, but next time, I would add on their homemade Calabrian pepper spread for more spice!"

We didn't have a reservation but we were able to get a counter seat which was perfect. We were sitting right in front of one of the chefs and literally just asked him to order for me since it was my first time and it was the best decision of the night.  For starters, the chopped salad was so damn good. I don't even like salad but I couldn't stop eating it. The warm bread and butter, OMG, made me forget about my diet.  The Margherita pizza was easily the best one I've had in all of SF. The quality of the ingredients was evident. The crust was crispy perfection and I'm still thinking about the next morning. The pasta was perfect Al dente, not a fan of red sauce but this was good. Definitely wanna try one of their white sauce options next time around.  It's a pricy meal for sure, but it's one where I felt like it was worth it. Great service, great food, what more does one need?"

We were in the heated outdoor seating which was kept warm enough (with jacket), although some of the seats were still wet from the rain. Service was fantastic! One thing to note is that there is a 10% surcharge for dine-in only (not the tip). Canus White Wine Carafe - Really light and crisp. I wouldn't recommend a carafe since the price did not seem worth the amount (which our server warned us about). Would go for the bottle to share next time! Focaccia - Please order this, the olive oil was fantastic and the focaccia itself was so soft and fluffy. Tomales Farmstead Teleeka - It came with a persimmon jam. This paired really well with the wine we ordered. The teleeka was creamy and has just a bordering bitterness to it. Spaghetti Amatriciana - Definitely al dente (maybe a little too al dente). But the guanciale (which they cure in house) was the star. So smoky. It lends itself well to the slight spiciness of the tomato sauce. Brasato di Agnello - My favorite dish. The lamb was tender and braised with onions that provided enough acidity to counteract the polenta. Even the person in my party who normally doesn't like lamb really loved it. It was so well balanced and warming on a cold night. Melanzana alla Parmigiana - It's a bit too salty with the layer of melted cheese on top. Otherwise the eggplant was layered beautifully with the sauce. It was satisfying while still remaining light. Tiramisu - Not the best tiramisu I've had. It tasted too much like alcohol along the edges and was dry towards the center."

We got the Gaga bean guangiale, cacio e Pepe, vongole, pappardelle, Al forno. Their vongole was off the charts. Cacio was up there too. We starved all day so ordered too much (even the waitress told us we were ordering too much food haha but she was impressed at how much we ate!) We took the rest home and had it for dinner next day.

        "Mike L.": "As much as I've been wanting to FINALLY check off Brenda's from my list of places to try (it's literally been years), it was hard to say no when my friend proposed Che Fico Alementari for dinner instead. Which says a lot, given all of the praise Brenda's has received for their crawfish beignets and fried chicken. Sure, most of that credit should really be going to (the original) Che Fico, but I wasn't about to start splitting hairs when there was the prospect of some legit pizza and pasta on the horizon! Now, compared to its older sister upstairs, Che Fico Alementari is seemingly a bit more casual, with a sort of wine bar-type of vibe (though I wouldn't say Che Fico is all that formal). Featuring a \"market\" of sorts, they have a wide selection of items you can pick up from their to-go counter, ranging from pantry staples and breads, to salumis and cheeses, to take & bake dishes and desserts. As for their dine-in menu, it's similar to Che Fico's in the types of things you can get (small plates, pastas, pizzas, meat-centric entrees, and vegetarian sides), but they don't overlap on anything specific. Regardless though, everything sounded so appealing, I only wish we had friends with us so that we could have tried even more! -- ZUCCA DELICATA - Roasted Delicata Squash, Hazelnut, Sage, Saba...$12 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/che-fico-alimentari-san-francisco?select=ApaqQOloLRIKkld99hUMCQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/che-</a>) In terms of flavor, this was pretty solid. I'd never had hazelnuts and sage with squash before, but they complemented everything quite nicely. I wasn't as high on the squash itself, though, as the texture was kind of weird - a little hard/crusty on the edges but creamy-ish on the inside. -- FUNGHI ARROSTO - King Trumpet Mushrooms, Shallots, Fines Herbs...$14 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/che-fico-alimentari-san-francisco?select=GXWidPSHo8scK7608TNseQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/che-</a>) As seemingly simple of a dish as this was, it was terrific! The chunks of mushrooms were super tender and I loved the mix of flavors from the herbs and shallots. We polished this off so quickly, it's a bummer this didn't come with more! -- CACIO E PEPE with Pecorino Romano, Black Pepper...$24 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/che-fico-alimentari-san-francisco?select=dMMvxiQXJd_FgNTkxCW7QA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/che-</a>) I was looking forward to this the most and it didn't disappoint. While the portion looked a bit light initially, this was actually rather filling! The pasta was cooked nicely and I liked how it wasn't overly sauced or peppery. -- SALSICCIA PIZZA - Che Fico Sausage, San Marzano, Gypsy Pepper, Treccione...$28 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/che-fico-alimentari-san-francisco?select=ChfaWqjsNqlItuDYfcf1Dw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/che-</a>) I generally love sausage pizzas, but this was just okay. While the tomatoes and sausage were good, the dough was underwhelming. Not only did it not hold up well (it was a bit soggy at the center), but it didn't have a lot of flavor on its own. -- CHOCOLATE BUDINO - Salted Caramel, Hazelnuts, Olive Oil, Sea Salt...$14 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/che-fico-alimentari-san-francisco?select=pCvRXMfC6x8ndFyGwC5hDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/che-</a>) Despite how full we were, the description for this sounded too good to say \"no\" to. The chocolate had a light consistency with a decadent flavor and I loved how well the hazelnuts (and salted caramel) accentuated the flavors while adding some sweetness and crunch. As far as service goes, I thought the entire staff was great. The hosts were very friendly and happily accommodated our request for the table closest to the door, our server was super helpful with our questions, and all of our dishes cane out rather swiftly. The only potential knock we had was that it was rather obvious they were trying to wrap our meal and turnover our table for the next party. Even then though, it was more than fair for them to do, as they had mentioned the time limit for every table when we sat down and have it listed on the menu); I just wish it had been done a little more subtly. That minor quibble aside, my only real regret with our otherwise enjoyable meal was that the bruschetta my friend had raved so much about wasn't on the menu while we were here (they rotate and tweak their dishes every so often). Oh well - I guess that just means I already know what else I'll be ordering when I come back to try their suckling pig that looks so good!"

Add to the fact that I don't eat pork anymore, I was a doubtful that I would find something worthwhile on the menu. On the flipside, I was pleased to find several options that fit my preferences.  We arrived at Suppenkche when it opened at 12pm on a Saturday. The restaurant reminded me of an indoor beer garden with long communal tables and benches. Customer service was great. We had two rotating servers, and they were both friendly, helpful, and attentive.  We got fried brie with lingonberry sauce to share. The brie bites were nicely crunchy, and the lingonberry sauce was delicious.  I had an entre off the brunch menu called Semmelkndel, which was basically a German version of \"biscuits\" with gravy and eggs. This typically comes with sausage, but I opted for the vegetarian option. Everything was tasty and flavorful. I absolutely loved the bread dumplings. If you love Thanksgiving stuffing, which I personally do, I'm willing to bet you'll love these dumplings as well. I also enjoyed the thick mushroom gravy and fluffy scrambled eggs."

The vibes are homey and there's a great selection of food and drink.  For drinks, you can never go wrong with a refreshing bananaweizen - lightly sweet!  Food wise, I love the sausages here - at one point I feel like they had a sausage sampler where you could select what type of sausages you wanted, not sure if they have that anymore because I didn't see it on the menu...but in lieu of that I'd still recommend trying the 2 bratwurst/2 frankfurter platter! Their weinerschnitzel is also super crispy if you're up for more meat. Of the brunch items, I would recommend splitting the bread dumplings with some friends - it is one of my favorites but also pretty heavy.  Overall, always a fun time at Suppenkuche!"

Our waiters were pretty busy and so it was hard to get their attention to order, get more water, or pay our bill. We ordered a house special, which was the currywurst that my partner really enjoyed and said it was similar to other dishes they've had. I ordered the onion button up pasta and thought the flavors were just too much onion and not complex - it was just strong and not very good - lots of cheese, lots of onion, but not much of a reason for me to keep eating it. The beets that came with the pasta was fine, but the other parts of the salad was just okay. It wasn't worth $20. I also felt like the pretzel was over cooked and very small for the price. My partner loves German food but this place confirms the fact that I am not as big a fan of the cuisine. For the price, I would have expected more."

My go-to previously was Leopold's, but they are closed for the time being and Suppenkuche came very highly recommended by another in our dinner party. No reservations, but luckily seated right away despite it being pretty busy. Pro tip (if you like traditional breaded schnnitzel): order the jaeger schnitzel, but request for breaded instead of sauteed pork loin. You get their amazing bacon infused mushroom sauce and spatzle with it. The schnitzel was perfectly golden fried and juicy and spatzle was on point. Portions were generous and worked well while paired with the other star of the show- german beer.. available in gratuitous servings! I was looking to get a 2 liter boot of my favorite german beer this time of year, Paulaner Marzen, but the 2 liter boots were all in use. I was working on a liter stein to hold me over when the waitress asked if I wouldn't mind getting a 2 liter poured into their 3 liter glass. \"Sure!\" and once she brought it out, I proceeded to pour my stein of beer into the 3 liter glass. Great service and this beer in particular is very tasty fresh from the tap. Get it. I managed to finish all 3 liters of beer and the meal. Suppenkuche did not disappoint! from what I remember..."

        "John B.": "Sadly, this place has really gone downhill lately. It used to be my favorite place in Hayes Valley, and we would come here often. They have simultaneously raised the prices significantly, cut down the menu significantly, lowered the food quality significantly, and saddest of all--removed the Messy Fries from the menu, one of their best and most popular items! At least the beer selection is still good--just don't come here for the food. It's not worth it anymore. I don't know what's happened to them."

        "Alice S.": "I had dinner here with a group of friends, and we all agreed that the food and beer were just okay, but the main dishes were way too overpriced for what you get and didn't match the description on the menu. For what it's worth, my German friend did say the food here was decently authentic (not necessarily cooked well), but the price is not worth coming back to regularly for a casual dinner.  I started with a 0.5L of the Weihnstephaner Hefeweiss, which I recommend if you want something light. It's a wheaty, fruity beer with hints of banana.  I also got the pilz pommes appetizer, which is basically fries drenched in creamy mushroom sauce and melted cheese on top. This was tasty and reasonably priced! I'm not usually a fan of plain fries, but the sauce and cheese really elevated the flavors.  For my main dish, I shared the wienerschnitzel with my partner. The menu stated that this dish comes with green salad, but we didn't get any! The breaded pork was somewhat dry and not memorable. I regretted getting this. If you're in Hayes Valley, I recommend coming here for some beer and appetizers but not for a full dinner. If you don't live in the area, this place isn't really worth going out of the way to visit unless you're really craving German food, and there aren't any other options around you."

After 10min in line, we could put our names in the waitlist. 20min later we were seated outside. The service is friendly, good atmosphere and big portions! I had a semi sweet cider (sorry, don't like beer). It was really good! The soup of the day was butternut squash. It was good, came quickly. The wienerschnitzel was good but liked the chicken one better. It comes with potatoes and bacon, also comes with a salad (just lettuce with dressing). The special was chicken schnitzel with veggies, mash potatoes, salad and a mushroom gravy. I wish I ordered that. I taste it and it was thin and yummy. I usually avoid chicken schnitzels because the cut is very thick.  Dessert was black forrest. Sorry but it was DRY. I made this dessert several times in the past and I know how it's supposed to taste. Where is the kirsch? The layer with cherries was really good. Needed to be moist and have more chocolate. It was more like a white forrest haha. -- Want a good schnitzel? Go there Good option in Hayes Valley."

We ordered the Calamari and Brussels Sprouts and Potato Skins to start and I ordered the ribeye as my main. The Calamari and Brussels Sprouts were an interesting combo and I liked the texture of the grilled squid. Potato Skins had lots of bacon, but nothing really out of the ordinary. The steak was cooked well and the chimichurri sauce on top was a nice, fresh compliment to the steak. Pricing was not bad for a steak of that size ($32). For drinks, we ordered the Super Smash Bros, which was great for a group and tasted nice and fresh! Service was very attentive and checked on us often. The restaurant does convert to a bar later in the night, so keep that in mind if you're planning to have a late dinner on the weekend. The lights got gradually dimmer as we ate."

Later in the evening the restaurant turns more into bar-vibes so it does get very loud - go early if you want a quieter meal. The sangria pitchers and delicious and not too sweet. The potato appetizer was delicious and crispy. The pork chop was super tender, and the applesauce was perfectly sweet and flavorful with buttery broccolini on the side. Overall I thought that the meal was super worth it for a cute sit down place!"

The vibe of the restaurant is simply amazing - it's lively, fun, and upbeat, with great music and a great crowd of people. Everyone seemed to be having a fantastic time, and I found myself immediately caught up in the infectious energy of the place. But what really sets this restaurant apart is the service. The staff are warm, welcoming, and attentive - they really go above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience. They're knowledgeable about the menu, quick to offer suggestions, and always happy to help. I recommend the pork buns and brussels sprouts!"

I also did a last minute change and everything was fine (maybe because I booked a table outside). I ordered the ricotta blueberry pancakes (I really liked them) and the veggie omelette (also this plate was good) that comes with potatoes and salad. My husband ate the burger (he said was very yummy), while my friends the whiskey glazed French toast and other plates that I don't remember, but everyone enjoyed the food. The service was good and everything came out at the same time, so we ate all together. Outside is also better if you have a stroller with you (they also have a bathroom with the changing station that is a plus because not every place has)."

My husband really enjoyed his steak and I liked the pork chop. If I were to order it again, I'd get it without the apple sauce on top. The cinnamon taste was a little strong, but when I pushed it off to the side the flavor did not linger. The apple turnover was also super good.

        "Lauren Y.": "We came to State Bird Provisions for their first 5:30 seating on a Friday night and had a wonderful time! Upon arrival we were quickly seated and given the low down on how the dining experience works. During service, carts and trays of small bites will be brought around with their respective cost per dish. Waiters will tally how many dishes you ordered + their cost and bill you at the end. Additionally, you can select other items off their menu to be brought to your table. We tried over 11 dishes and most were hits with some misses: Hog Island Oysters: super delicious and fresh. Slightly spicy with some fresh daikon to balance the heat. Definitely get at least one per person! Mushrooms: these were delicious, fresh, and a nice palette cleanser. I say take it or leave it with this one. Steamed egg tofu with chili crunch and mushrooms: this was so soft and silky. I loved the smooth texture against the crunchy chili flakes. Definitely get this one. Duck pate mousse with almond financiers: this was DIVINE! Definitely don't skip out on this. The mousse was light and decadent with flakey sea salt. The almond financiers reminded me of tiny cornbreads. This was a HIT. Shrimp Halibut fish sticks with avocado chutney: this was a miss for us. We don't know what we expected but it definitely was a remake of the frozen fish sticks we had as children. I didn't love that the fish was mushed up into a fish cake texture. Will definitely pass on this next time.  Steak tartare with multigrain flat bread: this was another HIT. So delicious and fresh. Probably one of the best steak tartares I've had. The steak was seasoned so well with bright flavors. I loved the multigrain bread and quinoa for some earthy additions. Duck breast: this was take it or leave it for me but pretty good. State bird chicken: the namesake dish! Definitely a must order. The chicken was tender, juicy, and such a unique crust!  Green garlic pancake with miso butter and trout roe: definitely a HIT for me. If you're feeling pretty full you should skip because it really is just extra carbs but I truly enjoyed the pancake (albeit I was expecting the traditional skinny scallion pancake) and the MISO butter was divine. I couldn't stop eating this.  Lamb and Polenta Ravioli: also a hit, I love the Al dente pasta and the tender lamb ragu inside. Smoked trout pure dip and fresh housemade chips: this was a miss for me. It was one of the first items that was brought out but unfortunately I did not love the pured fish texture. I definitely feel like this is a skip to save your appetite for the other items Mint ice cream sandwich: this was such a delicious ice cream sandwiched between lime macarons! Done super well. I would describe this as a mojito in a dessert form!  Overall this was a great and fun dining experience. I will say I did feel a little pressured to make a quick yes or no answer when some of the dishes were brought by (you get full pretty fast if you say yes to everything initially), so I suggest doing some research beforehand to see which items look appetizing so you can save room for when those come around! It would also be optimal to go with a group of four since most dishes have bites for four people and you can maximize the items you try without getting too fully The dishes will usually come around just once, but sometimes they'll bring our seconds or you can always request your waiter to bring out a dish from the back."

        "Hailey M.": "Creative food and experience! There's a rotating menu served dim sum style on trays carried around the room. You can also order from a selection of pancakes/toast, larger dishes, and desserts on the a la carte menu. We did all of it! The steak tartare was a masterpiece of complementary textures and flavors--the favorite at our table.  The steamed tofu may have been the least enjoyable simply because the extremely soft texture and cold temperature were disconcerting. Still delicious though.  One noteworthy event was when they forgot the CA State Bird we ordered, one of the servers gave us an extra order of pork belly complimentarily (and also rushed out the missing order).  The portions are tiny, as expected, which is kind of great because it means you get to try so many things :)"

My fianc and I were seated at one of the middle tables which seemed very close to the table right next to us that I felt I could here the other table's conversations. They also have booths available for bigger parties and bar seating as well.  The food is served like dim sum style where the waiters will come to each table one at a time presenting a dish. Prices ranged from $4-14 from the dim sum menu. Each dim sum item was enough for 2 people to share. And you can also order larger portion sized dishes from their a la carte menu.  My favorite dishes were the silken tofu and the pork belly. I really enjoyed the service and the atmosphere. We tried about 8 different dishes, and would definitely come back to try some more."

They'll help answer all your questions I had high expectations for the oyster and duck mousse. Both weren't great. (Skip the oysters) The oyster was bland and you could have gotten better flavor from another place with hotsauce and lemon The duck mousse was also sweet which I wasn't expecting. I thought it would be more savory. If you're looking for sweet, you can get it.  The pork belly was DELICIOUS! Highly recommend it! It was soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, and came with a fish sauce.  State bird quail was okay. I'd rather get 2-3 more orders of the pork belly.  Cucumber salad was solid. Skip the honey shrimp wonton. The shell was hard and didn't make the eating experience pleasant. Smoked duck sausage was okay. The fried beans were an experience. I'd get it again to show my friends.  If you like soup, get the clam soup, it was very filling Pass on the mint macaron. Get something else"

        "Joey N.": "Finally got to try this place and it was difficult to get a reservation for 5 people but here we are. I didn't read any review before we go so we can have a surprise and we did indeed. Didn't expect that they serve some items in the dimsum cart style, so you pick what and how many that you want. In this way food was served pretty quick and we can see it before deciding what to order. They also have a good menu of entrees and desserts if you still feel not too full after the cart dishes. Honestly, we were too full without even trying all the items from the cart and 3 entrees. - Manila Clam Donabe: love this soup when it's served with veggies. A bit salty to me so I'd much prefer having that with some bread. - A5 Wagyu Toast: totally different from what I expected. The beef was raw and tender, but the toast had a strong kick of wasabi, quite unexpected when we saw it. - Sourdough Pancake: interesting flavor but not sure if I like it or not. It's in that grey area of the taste for me since I wanted something a bit sweet. Below are some items from the cart that I loved the most: - Silken Tofu: more like Korean fusion and it was a nice pleasant surprise since the tofu was already seasoned somehow. We had two of this because they're too good. - Smoked Trout-Allium Chip'n'dip: awesome dish, one of the best dip dishes I've ever had. - Smoked Duck Andouille Sausage: nice flavor and texture, served with mashed potato. - Dashi Marinated Mushrooms: nice refreshing dish since it's a bit sour. - Red Trout: nicely fried and so well marinated. Felt like we should've gotten two of this. - Pork Belly & Citrus Salad: pork belly was crispy outside & tender inside, paired with fish sauce & herbs. We would've gotten two if we didn't have a lot of pork this week already. And finally their desserts were so good. Not too sweet and got that bitterness of dark chocolate and cafe that I like. We had Chocolate cafe de olla pudding & Paranip Cake. All of their staffs were so friendly and helpful. Nothing to complain about the service and food. We definitely see us coming back here next time since they change their menu often. Maybe bring our own booze next time as well if we don't drive."

I haven't had this much difficulty ranking dishes in a long time, as so many were incredible. The dim sum style of having staff go around with the food on trays or carts is great. You get to eat quickly without feeling rushed, AND you get to see exactly what you're going to eat, so there's no wondering what you're getting yourself into and how much food is on each plate. Some highlights that can't be missed: - CA State Bird. It was my first time having quail and they did a great job. Juicy and flavorful. - Brussels sprouts. I LOVE Brussels, and these were prepared really nicely and seasoned well. - Grilled sourdough and burrata. What could be bad. - Beets. Make sure you get a little bit of each component into each bite for a great complement of flavors. - Sourdough-sauerkraut pecorino & ricotta pancakes. One of their staples. Difficult to describe the flavors, but trust me you have to try this. Great atmosphere. Would love to sit at the bar next time to see the kitchen at work. Can't wait to return."

        "Lena H.": "We came here for dinner with a reservation at 5:30 and there was already a line before it opened. The restaurant was nearly fully seated right away so a reservation is highly recommended though they accept walk-in.  We are a party of two people but seated literally at a four people setting with another couple. The \"two\" tables were literally had one or 1.5 inches space in between. Really feel like having dinner with another couple we don't know while dating which is odd. The ambience is very noisy and hard to have a good conversation for a date night.  Menu is interesting because they have what they called \"dim sum\" style where the waiter or waitress will bring you the small items (The Provisions on the menu that is $8-$14 per item) and you can order straight away from what it is presented before you. We got the duck liver mousse, brussel sprouts, the smoked trout chips and dip, and the beets from that \"dim sum\" style menu. It is nothing like dim sum you got from a Chinese restaurant when they say dim sum! But I like the idea that foods are presented before you order and they serve shortly after seated to fulfill hungry tummy.  We ordered the cheddar pancakes with squash, avocado whipped ricotta toast, red trout and the CA state bird with provisions from the Commandable menu. They don't have cocktails, only wine and beer which is a big disappointment.  Now the most important part is the food taste and quality. I have to say I am not impressed at all for a Michelin one star restaurant. The foods are just an okay. The most disappointing is the CA State bird provisions (fried quail) which should be their signature dish like the name of the restaurant. The breading is too thick and the quail is bland, a bit hard rather than crispy. Popeyes chicken tasted better than their fried quail lol. The portion is small but we ordered a ton of foods so small portion seemed fine in our case.  The red trout is also a disappointment, a bit dry without any sauce and also bland. My husband took a couple small bites and the rest was taken away by the waitress (she didn't even bother asking how's the trout while a large portion was left behind).  The avocado whipped ricotta toast is also a miss. I made better avocado toast at home lol. The pancake is not the typical pancake you have from breakfast. It is dense and thick with seeds inside and a thin layer of cheddar crisp-up cheese and pan fried with the squash and other toppings at the top. Not all that great.  My favorite are the brussel sprouts and the beets. The smoked trout chips and dip is okay.  I wonder if their head chef is taking a day off and we happen to dine in today? Overall disappointed at the food taste and quality for a star Michelin restaurant."

        "Yanli X.": "Came here for my birthday last week. We had a great time but I can't give more than 4 stars unfortunately. Many items were too salty, which was especially difficult since there wasn't really a neutral main carb to eat it with. Oysters: good oyster but wasn't wowed by the accompaniments/seasonings Beets: I really liked the spices they used. I'm a huge fan of beets but the flavor was really strong and too sweet. Egg tofu: Delicious. I always love egg tofu and the mushrooms were such an interesting twist. Brussels sprouts: Nicely crisped up and tender. I wished they were a little more generous with the sauce Liver mousse: financiers were quite greasy. The mousse has a boozy kick to it, which really turned me off even though I love pate and liver. Garlic knots: got this as an attempt to assuage the saltiness. Had a nice chewy texture. I'm sorry but I had to scrape the salt off to enjoy it. Sauerkraut pancakes: the cheese complements the sauerkraut really well. I honestly wish this came out sooner because I was already full by this time! Trout belly: make sure to added that squeeze of lemon! It really brought it all together and hit me with a wave of nostalgia. State bird: this was my favorite! The inside was soft, tender, and perfectly seasoned. The outside was a thin breadcrumb coating that was buttery and had a pleasing, comforting flavor. Donabe: really rich miso soup with fried tofu cubes. The firm tofu was coated in a starch and then fried, giving it an extra bite even soaking in the soup. The tofu also had a very clean and dense tofu flavor. The soup has a ton of Sancho which is one of my favorites. It's citrusy and also a bit numbing. We actually couldn't finish this soup and brought it home to make noodles with the next day.  We also had the peanut milk which was so yummy. Our server described it as a Reese's smoothie which was spot on! The space can be a bit noisy but seems like a fun place to come with a group of friends."

        "Holly H.": "FIRST VISIT: 4 stars Went for the first time to celebrate a birthday back in the first half of 2022 (almost a year ago!). Menu's will come stamped with happy birthday if you let them know ahead of time, and dessert will come with a candle. At this point they were still not doing the dim sum style service because of COVID, so it was just a regular casual sit down restaurant. I was only able to nab a late reservation (9pmish) for my desired day - all other times were already booked out. Definitely plan ahead with booking a reservation if you want to dine at this restaurant! I ordered the sake flight ($28) with the rest of the food, but it was the first to come out (would have been nicer if this came with at least one of the dishes that I ordered, but not a big deal). The flight is in wine glasses and of course all the sake looks the same. My party was told which was which, but it would have been nicer to have an easier way to distinguish what each was meant to be because the wait staff said it so quickly that we missed the explanations.  For snacks, my party got the following: - Duck liver mousse ($8.00): I thought the mousse had a strange after taste to it, so I didn't love this dish that much. I did enjoy the financiers - very small and cute and not dry! - Inari ($8.00): Pretty tasty! Had a lot of ingredients I liked in it but also wasn't too memorable. - Trout dip ($14.00): This was one of my favorites of the night - I love chips, and I loved their dip. I wish there were more chips because the chips disappeared faster than the dip.  For provisions, we got:  - Kimchi croquettes ($16.00): This was a larger plate of food than expected, and the croquettes were great. Wasn't a fan of having the bean sprouts, radish, etc. as a \"salad\" on the side.  - Tartare ($16.00): Not a huge lamb fan, so I didn't eat too much of this. Wasn't too bad and actually enjoyed it more than the taste of the duck liver mousse. We got a single commandable: - OG half bird ($20.00): Just as it says - it's half a quail, but since it's fried, it tastes like fried chicken.  For dessert, we ordered two but got three due to a mistake in the kitchen (third dessert was comped): - Half lemon cake ($6.50) - Sorbet sundae ($12.00): This was a dessert we ordered but they didn't bring out originally because of a mistake in the kitchen. When notifying the staff of this mistake, they thought we wanted the full sorbet sundae when we wanted the half portion. We just ate and paid for the full version because it was late and didn't want to bother waiting for another correction.  - Ice cream sandwich (comped): This was the dessert that came out by mistake. I actually think I enjoyed this dessert the most even though it was not necessarily anything special."

        "A O.": "Super disappointed. I was looking forward to this place for a while, but rarely get to this side of town. I've eaten amazing seafood in 12 different countries and make frequent visits to Japan which I just returned from. All I ordered was the ceviche, but the first list of ingredients was seasonal fish and it was practically a bowl of baby shrimp followed by the listed ingredients. I'm not even sure if I want to go back for the rest of the menu. I do the same with Italian restaurants if they can't even make a good Margherita then I don't even bother with the other pizzas. I've eaten at 90%+ of the restaurants in San Francisco over the span of 30 years; from hole in the walls to Benu. For an establishment that promotes quality seafood that was one of the most depressing bowls of ceviche I've ever had. There are Mexican and Peruvian restaurants in the Mission that aren't even known for their ceviche that make just as good of one or better. Nice people. Clean place. I'll give them that. The fish in the glass fridge looked great just wish it was in the bowl. There was maybe several pieces of fish. The rest was baby shrimp which wasn't even listed as an ingredient and it was bigger than the fish pieces themselves. Sure we can get technical and say well they're shell \"fish\" but let's get real people in the culinary world refer to them as crustaceans. So much for pre-tipping 20%."

        "Christina L.": "For me -- this placed passed the \"lives up to the hype\" test. I moved to SF a couple months ago and kept hearing from folks that this was a good spot for fish and chips.  Food -- fish and chips dish was fire. Fish had really good breading. When you bite into it it's a complex layer of batter that hits. Fries were subpar for me. Decent, but could be better. Poke was a heck yeah. Chips pretty good too! Ambiance -- cute outdoor seating with garden lights (parklet and some tables tucked on the side). It was cold and chilly when we went, so if there was a heater that would've been rad, but not a deal breaker. My bf pointed out the hooked fish design with the logo and (look for the two hooks!)  Service -- good, nothing to rave about nothing to complain about. Line was short when we went, thankfully! Food came out fast.  I would definitely come back and tell friends / fam to come. I could see this spot have a much longer line and opting for dine out + heading out to la playa to enjoy. Next on my list is to try the fish tacos :P"

        "Ella A.": "4/1/2023 - Dinner date at a neighborhood restaurant. Always drove by and saw a long line. Bookmarked it as a must-try seafood restaurant. Seatings are available along the side of the building and on an elevated deck in front where the parking is.  Love the concept. Pick your seafood and they'll prepare it fresh upon order. Line is out the door, both to order and to pick up. Many of their items were sold out, so it's better to get there early. Cashier forgot to charge us for our drink so had to get back in line to order it again. This was an inconvenience. Ordered the kid's fish-n-chips, grilled rock cod and rock cod burrito. Fish-n-chips were ok. Flaky with a crunch. Fries were mediocre. Grilled rock cod plate served with pico de gallo, guacamole, pickled cabbage, rice and beans. Everything was piled on top of each other, next to each other, absorbing all the random, underwhelming, bland flavors.  Burrito was alright. Didn't taste any fish.  Seasoning definitely lacked.  People who ordered after us got their food much quicker than us. Had to wait nearly an hour to get our basic meal.  Wanted to like it and support it since it's a neighborhood spot. But don't think we'll be back. Not worth the wait at all. Probably a cool spot just to grab a beer. That's about it."

        "Michelle H.": "Great spot to stop by after a day at the beach or hike. The fish and chips were so good! I couldn't get enough of the tartar sauce and the fish was flaky, tons of fries too. Pineapple agua fresca was also pretty refreshing.  I tried the habanero carrot hot sauce which added a nice kick. It wasn't terribly spicy and you can see the carrot pulp at the bottom.  They only have outdoor dining in this cute parklet and a few tables along the street. Perfect for a sunny day! It might be hard to snag a seat on the weekends because I had to wait around for parties to leave around 2pm weekday."

        "Ziyan C.": "I already loved the Hook Fish Co in Mill Valley and was pleasantly surprised to learn of this location in the city!  While the fish tacos were excellent (5 stars: super fresh, amazing light crunch to the breading, even the toppings were above and beyond. I said to my friend \"this radish is amazing, and I don't even like radishes!), it was pretty stressful being here around 12:45pm on a warm Saturday in April. There was a line to order (10 min), a wait for food (30 min), and there were a lot of people waiting (with no organized line or waitlist) for their scattering of sidewalk and parklet tables. While it's a charming space and I'm sure it's lovely on most days, it's definitely not enough to handle the weekend crowd. The cost was $48.64 total for 2 fish taco and one chips/guac order. Parking was surprisingly not bad, we got a spot very quickly half a block away."

It exceeded my expectations because I was not expecting from the tacos but it was a huge burst in flavors. The fried fish was greatly accompanied by the pickled vegetables and the creamy avocado. The fish was flaky and fresh.  Service was super quick, it is meant to be mainly grab and go because there aren't too many seatings available. Tables are all self service so you will wait for your own table and clean up after yourself. All tables are outdoor so you can enjoy the nice breeze and sunny weather."

        "Sophie K.": "TLDR: I don't eat a lot of fish and chips, but it was the best fish and chips I've ever had.  CONTEXT: Came after playing ultimate frisbee at the beach and I was starving on a Saturday afternoon. There was a decent line even at 3:45pm on a Saturday!  AMBIANCE: Very casual but it is cute. They only have outdoor seating, which are a bunch of wooden benches (some with tables, some without). There's some plants which helps create a cute ambiance.  SERVICE: It's counter service so I can't say much here. The people working seem nice enough! Being that it was so busy, we didn't get our food all that fast, but it's to be expected.  FOOD: Neither my boyfriend nor I eat a lot of fish and chips, but we agreed it was the best fish and chips we've ever had. They were hot, crispy, flaky, and tender. Whatever seasoning they had worked quite well. Sometimes fish and chips is plain, but not with this one. To be honest the fries (chips) could have been better. They were lacking in flavor and could have been crispier, but they were definitely edible. We also got the soup of the day, which was a red curry with albacore tuna. I enjoyed it -- it came with a small bowl of rice with lime. The lime and rice really complimented it he soup well and gave it some added substance. Wasn't knock your socks off, especially the fish in it (pretty fishy flavored and not very tender), but I still enjoyed it.  OVERALL: Would recommend, especially their fish and chips."

        "Mito I.": "Brief Summary: - There are outdoor seats, but low turnover rate - Can order ahead with the QR code on the window near the entrance - Coffee is not sour - has seasonal menus A must come again place for me. Their breads are delicious. I ordered the kaya bun and their milk bun. I also ordered, on a whim, an asparagus egg salad sandwich. This is one of the seasonal menus, that were listed on a sign at the door. I was intentionally planning to order the kaya toast, but I opted for this one because I was craving something savory over sweet. I later returned quickly in line to order the kaya bun before I went out. The asparagus egg salad sandwich was so delicious! I would list Breadbelly's sandwiches as my top recommended bakeries. The asparagus is fried in a tempura way, so it was hot and crispy. It created a great texture to the complimentary squishy and soft egg salad. The egg salad had faint hints of citrus -- I'm going to guess it was yuzu -- and a kick of mustard (or horseradish?). I loved how light the sandwich was and didn't have the greasy weight post-eating. The bread that was used for the sandwich was a star of the dish as well. It was soft and had a wonderful squish texture. I'm very excited to try their milk bread as my weekday's breakfast because I assume this loaf will have a similar texture. The only negative was the outdoor seating. There are tables, benches, and chairs to fit a good amount of guests, but the turnover is low. I have noticed there are guests chatting away or some just sitting and browsing their phones when they have finished their food."

        "Sierra S.": "From drinks, sweet treats, to sandwiches, they nail every item on their menu. The sesame horchata is the perfect level of sweet and doesn't have an overwhelming sesame flavor, it's subtle. And the kaya toast!! It's a 10/10, absolutely recommend giving it a try.  There isn't indoor seating available but they have a handful of patio tables outside. There aren't umbrellas/shade so if you're planning to stay and eat, bring sunglasses (that is if Carl the fog isn't out)."

This is the perfect place to stock up on pastries for the week, a small bite and quality coffee. Currently, you order at the counter and hover outdoors for a seat to open up. Considering how busy this place is, it would be great if they implemented more formal table service but I totally consider the labor constraints.  I ordered the Shrimpwich and Yuzu Americano! The shrimpwich, although very assuming, was soooooooo good! The shrimp patty was piping hot and extremely crispy. And the slaw and sauce paired the patty were to die for. I could have a couple of these sandwiches. The Yuzu Americano was extremely refreshing as well! Quality coffee with the bubbly goodness of seltzer.  All around a solid cafe with quality food. It would be nice if they had a larger space considering how busy the location was, but I'll still give this place a big 5 stars!"

It's not your normal everything bagel, it has caramelized onions and cream cheese in the middle.  Kaya toast - apparently it went viral on tik tok a few months ago so I had to order this. It was a bit sweeter than I like but the bread itself is so soft and airy  Belly dog - the individual meat pieces on the hot dog is so tender and flavorful but the hot dog itself is a bit salty  Matcha latte - its thick matcha and right amount of sweetness"

The kaya toast was perfectly toasted and was rich and creamy. The portion size was just right and left me feeling satisfied but not too full. The kaya bun was equally impressive. The bun itself was soft and fluffy, and the kaya filling was just the right amount of sweet. It was like a little slice of heaven in every bite.  The service at Bread Belly is was pretty quick. Line wasn't too long but they do sell out so be sure to come early!"

Even with the parklet outside, the crowd of families lining up builds fast especially on the weekends.  The kaya bun, a soft milk bun that explodes with silky sweet coconut pandan cream when you bite into it. Fan favorite Honey sesame fig danish, earthy sweet notes from the honey fig finished with pillowy danish bread covered in crispy toasted sesame, superb. Not an ube tart, toasted meringue topping a light creamy sweet potato filling, the toasted butter crust holds it all together while crowning it as my personal favorite of the day picturesque neighborhood backdrop depending on the weather and fast service even with the weekend rush. Good family & pet friendly parklet outside."

This is a savory pastry that's bready on the outside and filled with decadent curry on the inside. The curry comes with chunks of sweet potato (how on earth does it fit?) and is absolutely perfect on a cold SF morning. - Breakfast Sandwich: Top three breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. The sandwich is so soft and generously filled with egg, leafy veggies, and a red pepper paste that's reminiscent of kimchi. I would eat this for dinner if they offered it. It took all my self restraint not to order their other pastries, so I'll have to make another trip back to try everything else."

I prefer croissants to be fluffy and crispy, so didn't like how this one was twice baked, which made it too hard and crunchy The flavors are outstanding, but 4/5 because everything is soooo pricey even for SF standards :( but i'd come back for whenever i'm craving anything kaya, the curry bun, or to try more of their menu!"

We ordered ahead of time and were able to pick up our order almost instantly, which I highly recommend. There's an outdoor seating area for guests, self service. I had the breakfast sandwich and the husband had the biscuit-wich. Both were excellent- the fermented chili paste in the breakfast sandwich gave the sandwich a nice kick. The husband also liked his biscuit wich. The black sesame cappuccino was fire and I would order this every time! Overall I can see the hype- food is really good albeit on the expensive side for what you get. Would definitely check this place out!"

Only thing I wished was if it was toasted Kaya toast - can't go wrong, delicious kaya jam with a touch of nice flaky sea salt. Definitely order this when you visit here for the first time Twice Baked Croissant - extra flaky however the filling was okay - very blood orange forward with hint of guava and no rose taste. Pretty croissant but didn't think it was worth 10 dollars Great (but on the pricier end) bakery for Asian inspired breads and pastries if you're in the Richmond area. Most pastries are between 8-10 dollars. There's seating outside and you order at the counter. Not too much to comment on service since it's a pretty quick process. There often isn't a very long line which contrasts the long (but worth it) lines at Arsicault"

They had me at \"crawfish beignets\" I just knew I would never look at crawfish or beignets the same. Me and my husband ordered so much food, by the time we were done dining in, we had so much food to take back to our hotel. Just when you thought things just couldn't get any better, I ordered the watermelon tea and they need to bottle that up and sell that to the world. We were super uncertain what to order since everything sounded so good, but we ended up getting a piece of fried thigh to share and the dipping sauce was delicious. That sauce reminded me of home... it reminded me of Filipino banana ketchup that we use for lechon or any fried goods. The service was fast. The guys that waited on our table were very friendly and were pretty quick. There was a table over and one that had spilled so much drinks everywhere and the staff handled it like a champ. No complaints, they worked together and handled that table and got it ready for the next guest. Staff was friendly and the guy that was waiting our table was waiting several tables and it looked like he did a great job. The restaurant isn't that big. It's pretty compacted inside. Tables are not that far from each other and it gets pretty loud. As much people that goes in and out of that place, you would think it wouldn't be that up kept, but it's pretty clean inside. Lines get kind of long but it goes by kind of quick. It's in walking distance from a lot of different hotels, but we stayed a little ways from this place so we had to take the car out here. The food is delicious and if I was ever in the neighborhood again I would come back."

Great soul food and would come back to try more items. *** A M B I A N C E *** There were many beautiful mirrors on the wall and the restaurant had a warm and welcoming vibe.  *** F O O D *** $14.50 Beignet Flight $23.00 Shrimp & Grits w/ Spicy Tomato-Bacon Gravy They are known for the beignets so of course we had to get some. The Beignet Flight included one of each flavor that they serve: crawfish, plain, chocolate, and apple. They were warm and fluffy and I liked all of them, but since I prefer savory over sweet, my favorite was the crawfish one. It was unique since beignets are usually sweet. The shrimp and grits is also one of their popular menu item so my friend and I shared that. It was my first time having something like this. It was flavorful and cheesy though a bit heavy, but I still enjoyed it. Our other friend got the fried chicken and said she liked it. *** S E R V I C E *** The staff was welcoming and very friendly.

Came on a cold, crisp Saturday morning recently, shocked to see no line and got seated right away! I guess the hype has died down, but the food and service most certainly have not declined one bit! We started with large, pint sized mimosas and their Beignet Flight of the crawfish, plain, apple and chocolate. They had Dungeness Crab beignets as a special as well so we had to try that too! The crab was super fresh and mixed with some mayo and chives. They are a bit heavy handed with the paprika on top but they have mastered the soft, fried, yet not greasy dough. The crawfish is mixed with melted cheese and spices and now I'm craving them again as I type! For my main, I was torn between the Shrimp Benedict on their special menu or the classic Fried Catfish Benedict and the server recommended the catfish as it goes really well with the rich hollandaise and hearty hash. The eggs were poached perfectly and the fish was light and flavorful! No disappointment at all! My husband got the Fried Oyster Po'boy and he enjoyed that too. We loved everything we had and it had us stuffed till dinner time!  Service was excellent and I always appreciate honest servers who make great recommendations! Hope there isn't a wait again next time I return! Thank you, Brenda, for your many years of serving us solid, distinguished soul food and congrats on expanding to Oakland!

My guava mimosa was just meh, nothing I would come to order specifically from Brenda's. The inside of my granny Smith apple beignet was super dry and not really warm. I was imagining more of apple pie filling. My friend's chocolate beignet wasn't completely melted inside so she wasn't very enthusiastic about hers either.

        "Sergio V.": "I have been coming to this restaurant for years and years. And I always keep repeating. Possibly one of my favorite Italian restaurants. This is the local hood cozy type restaurant, which makes you feel at home for its intimate ambiance. Decoration, lightning, wall colors are just fabulous, paying attention to details and clearly displaying artistic and Italian stylish traits. Added to that they project old classic Italian movies on the wall, which is the icing on the cake. Both with a romantic partner or a small group of friends, this is an outstanding and enjoyful dining experience, tasting truly Italian dishes and good Italian wines, falling on a kind of gourmet touch. And yes, not only is the owner Francesco Italian, but also most of his staff/team - they're all super friendly and the service is stupendous. You can even speak Italian with them! So, for starters I tend to go to options like Salmone marinato, Vitello Tonnato, Tagliere di salumi e formaggi and burrata. For pastas, I like their Tagliatelle al ragu \"Della Nonna\", Agnolotti al plin or Tortelli neri di zucca e gamberi. Other delicious main courses are: Petto D'anatra, Filleto di manzo, Trancio di pesce, Guancia di vitello. Oh, and they used to have a luscious Branzino, which was a fave. They have a great variety for white and red Italian wines. For dessert I cannot help frequently choosing their fluffy Tiramis or a Mousse al Cioccolato. You can also have an Affogato, an Italian real espresso or try a grppa di camomila for digestive, among other options. This is for sure a local business to try out!!!"

I didn't order drinks, but my coworkers loved their espresso martini. For appetizer, I got Insalata di polpo: warm Spanish octopus salad, fennel, celery, potatoes, Taggiasca olives, peas puree, lemon dressing. This was delicious. It was tender and flavorful.  For pasta, I got Cappellacci al nero, zucca e capesante: home-made hat-shaped squid ink ravioli, kabocha squash filling, garlic-chili evoo sauted, Hokkaido scallops carpaccio. This was my favorite. The ravioli was cooked perfectly and the scallops went very well with it. There was a nice kick to it. I wanted more! For the main dish, I chose Petto d'anatra: seared duck breast, french potato, red wine poached d'Anjou pear, cocoa grilled organic carrot, red wine reduction demi glace. The duck was surprisingly good. The skin was very crispy and the perfect amount of fattiness. The carrots were a bit tiny. This dish wasn't the most presentable.

        "Priscilla L.": "Well my review is based on the private room downstairs of the restaurant so my experience will be different from those who ate upstairs in the main dinning room which looked cozy like someone's home. Downstairs private room felt like a garage with a long bar and a restroom that was not sound proof at all. So much for privacy when people can hear you flushing and opening the garbage can inside. It's good for a big group with nice decorations and furniture. I personally wouldn't come back. I didn't pay for this dinner, so I can give you my thoughts about this French restaurant. Yes quality food is there. The only three standout dishes that gave me the wow factor was the appetizer: Vitello Tonnato Sliced which is the pink roasted veal, salsa tonnata, crunchy celery, fried Sicilian capers $20 was thinning sliced and flavor was excellent,  Main Course: Brasato $43 was a 4 hour braised, 6oz certified Piemontese flat iron beef, Italian organic Mulino Sobrino soft polenta, sauteed organicmushrooms was melt in your mouth goodness! Wow! Yummy in my tummy and I was disappointed I had to share this dish.  For others in my dinner party of eight, not many touched the fish, but I thought it was tender and juicy. It didn't have a special sauce that gives a wow factor, but I still thought of it was good. It was called the Trancio di Pesce, the $38, the 6 oz grilled local wild seabass,organic butternut squash puree, sauteed escarole, pine nuts, raisins, Taggiasca olives, anchovypaste.  Finally everyone in my party inhaled the Tortellini in Brodo, the $27 beef tenderloin-prosciutto diparma-mortadella-parmigiano filling, hen-beefstock was excellent dumplings.  The other food was just ok and didn't stand out too much.  Homemade toasted bread was nice and wished I had more. However, The butt end of the bread could have broken my teeth as I attempt to eat it. I gave up halfway. Too hard end piece. The rest of bread was good.  The Extremely rich Crema Bruciata was $11 classic creme brulee with freshberries, was too rich for me, I shouldn't have tried to eat the whole thing, because I was starting to feel a bit sick. It was more on the too creamy liquidly side for me but it did have an excellent crust on top.  This was an educational seminar I attended so I didn't pay for this dinner. The service was really slow, main courses didn't even arrive till after the presentation was done. Normal restaurants would serve while the presentation was going on. This place just served 3 light appetizers and yummy eggnog and stopped service. I thought wow, is this all there is? I thought I was going to pass out due to hunger. I am sure the other people in my party felt the same way.  Would I come back on my own for French food? I probably would say no. I am sure others would enjoy a romantic, classy, evening upstairs in main dinning rooms. I am more of a rack of lamb and steak person."

Really European vibes and nice warm lighting at night. Service was also excellent here! Food was decent, but not worth the high price points. I had the agnolotti with lamb and the orecchiette, the latter of which I definitely preferred (plus it was a bigger serving). The tagliere appetizer was also fun, with a lot of yummy cheeses and meats!"

I was really enticed by the fresh pasta options on the menu, and how the whole place reminded me a little bit of Foreign Cinema with the quirky interior and the black and white projected films. We had a super early seating, because some how in my mind, it would be warmer. Luckily we didn't have to sit outside, but note that you can only make reservations for the outdoor areas.  The wait staff was exceptionally attentive and friendly. We got some pastas, got in some happy hour appetizers, and had the duck breast. The duck was ESPECIALLY delicious. The sauce, the mash, the whole plate. I practically licked it clean the flavor was so delicious. Definitely can see how everything on the menu might not be a hit but certain things absolutely are. Will return!"

The service was great and really attentive for such a large party. We were seated on the back patio and it was fun to walk through the kitchen. The food took a long time to come out because of our large party but they did not mess up one order which was impressive. The food itself was good but the pasta was lowkey hard.. I would consider it undone and not aldente, although the flavor was great. Portion was small for the price, we needed bread to get full."

Francesco was great to communicate with and made our experience a lovely one. We will absolutely be back. Great customer service + delicious wine + the best pasta"

I came here on a Friday night with my husband and we were very happy when we left from here. This restaurant has great quality food, good quantity and it's affordable as well in comparison to other French restaurants. For starters we ordered the spicy lamb sausage and the truffle fries. Both starters were really good and filling, specially the truffle fries were amazing with the perfect amount of favour of truffle.  For the mains I got myself the half roasted organic chicken whereas my husband got the veal in creamy white wine sauce with vegetables and mushrooms. Both the dishes were so flavourful and heavenly. My husband finished his in less than 5 minutes to be honest. I loved how juicy the chicken was and the mashed potatoes were so good. The best part about the chicken was the quantity, it was huge. Half of it was my meal for the next day also. The service wasn't that great, they need to improve on that but besides that it was a good experience.  This place is a great value for money, would highly recommend this place for French food."

        "Kelly K.": "Edited review to add - the owner reached out to me via private message to apologize and invite us for a meal. Very much appreciated and speaks volumes to the professionalism and attention to service. Thank you. My husband and I went to Chez Maman West for brunch before a performance at the nearby Herbst Theatre. We knew the restaurant doesn't take reservations, so we arrived at noon, two hours before the show. We added our name to the list for an indoor table. We understood it would take longer than those who were flexible about sitting outside, but what we weren't expecting was for several groups on the list after us to be seated inside before us. This was after the hostess told us we would be next, and it would be about 5 minutes. In total we waited an hour. It was a frustrating start to the experience.  Our server came immediately after we were seated and took our drink order and said she would give us time with the menu unless we knew what we wanted. In the interest of time, we ordered food right away. Our server was very friendly. We shared a bowl of French onion soup while I had a blood orange mimosa. My husband's latte didn't arrive until after we finished the soup, which was fine but a little surprising. The French onion soup was delicious.  After about a half hour wait, my husband had the Angus burger with added mushrooms and I had the smoked salmon omelette. They gave me the wrong omelette at first but our server quickly fixed it once we flagged her down. At this point I'm getting quite anxious about arriving to the theater in time so I quickly eat half my food and we paid the bill and left. Overall it's a cute spot with a hustling staff but I would suggest only going for a Sunday brunch if you are able to spend 2+ hours there. The mussels looked good but I can't say we'll be back."

        "Mehrnaz H.": "We have always loved coming to Chez Maman when in the mood for casual French food. Tried it on a rainy Saturday for an early dinner. Got to the restaurant around 5PM. There was immediate seating outside under heated lamps, but opted to wait for inside seating. The wait was about 20-30 minutes. Started with the French Onion Soup, followed by Nioise Salad and Provenal Moule served with fries. The meal was great, honestly I was in the mood for the onion soup on a cold rainy night and it hit the spot. The only disappointment was the quality of the seared ahi tuna which was a bit tough and overcooked. Service was great and the staff was very efficient with serving and cleaning the tables.  Always great to visit... till next time."

The table was alright but felt a little squished and also maybe not the best ambiance for the area -- there was a homeless man passing by within arms length a couple of times asking for money etc.  Dinner menu is simple so we ordered: Veal $29 two thin slices with mushrooms on top of a bed of carrots and squash. It was pretty bland. Duck confit $32 had a sweetness to it, and a little dry. There's some potato au graten and green beans. Makes me really appreciate the Chinese whole roast ducks I get!  Kiddo got salmon burger with fries $15 Service was excellent, courteous and consistently prompt but for the total of $85, I just wasn't satisfied or impressed with the food.  There is a SF mandate of 4%."

For starters, we order the Warm Goat Cheese salad and Beef Tartar! Both super! I loved the crispy exterior of the goat cheese and the beef tartar was extremely flavorful. The fettuccine was a bit mid, unfortunately. It lacked salt but I appreciated how plentiful it was with mushrooms. The superstar of the dinner was the chicken. The mixture of the lemon sauce plus the creamy mash potatoes were stellar. Truthfully, I'd come back to the restaurant just to have that dish again. Definitely a standout restaurant in Hayes that you need to check out!"

While this place isn't the largest inside, they do have outdoor seating with an enclosure around it so it protects you from the wind. We were able to be seated pretty quickly for a party of 6, and the waiters here were helpful. Even though this place serves French food, thankfully the pricing here is pretty reasonable by SF standards.  For our food, we decided to get a Chez Maman charcuterie plate along with Les Moules Poulette. The charcuterie plate was delicious, with a nice mustard that was served alongside it. The meat itself was flavorful and tender, with a nice aesthetic presentation on a wooden board. Les Moules were also great, and if you are a fan of mussels then you'll enjoy this dish. The fries that come along with it actually go pretty well with the sauce they use too.  Overall, if you want a nice French brunch that is reasonably affordable, then this is a nice place to check out!"

The salad was really refreshing, and the salmon crepe had a lot of spinach in it too, so I felt like I was eating super healthy. It'd be better if the smoked salmon could be less salty though. This restaurant is quite small, so the tables are pretty close together, so I didn't feel super comfortable to talk about anything too personal."

The mango mimosa was good. The beignet flight was a doughy, sugar bomb so early in the morning--was not prepared for the size. The crawfish was the best one; it was so savory! Decided to also try the catfish, a side of spinach, mac & cheese, and a biscuit. The waitress suggested doing the meat and three combo, which was cheaper than ordering everything individually. Initially thought the combo was just a dinner option; was pleasantly surprised to learn it was available during breakfast! It was a good amount of food served on an old fashioned lunch tray. The catfish was fried golden, but was a bit chewy. The mac & cheese wasn't memorable, but the spinach was delicious. I ended up taking the biscuit to go, since I was stuffed. It warmed up nicely the next day and tasted extra delicious with their homemade fruit spread."

We had wanted to try the meat and three, since this restaurant is the only one on the west coast to serve food in this fashion, however we were going during breakfast/brunch hours and they only offer meat and three for supper. Alas, this did not stop us, as we simply ordered three sides and an order of fried chicken of the a la carte menu! Wow wow wow, everything we ate was insanely delicious - packed with flavor and cooked perfectly. We got red beans and rice, stewed okra and tomatoes, Mac and cheese and fried chicken. I think the okra and tomatoes were my favorite - they had the perfect texture and were seasoned beautifully, but honestly everything was insanely delicious and I know for sure we'll be dreaming of this place for months to come until we can visit again. Oh, we also got the flight of beignets, which were crispy on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside, with flavorful fillings. The crawfish and cheese was my favorite, but they were all bomb and I could eat them all the time and be happy.  tldr; unbeatable food in a lovely location"

I chose the meat and three options so I got the fried chicken with three sides. My sides were mac & cheese, red bean and rice and the cream biscuit. To be honest I think the cream biscuit was my favorite overall. The chicken was crispy but I feel like it could use a little bit more flavor. The mac & cheese was good in terms of consistency, but it was sweet which I didn't understand why it was sweet. I had to use hot sauce to eat the whole thing. The red bean and rice was lacking serious flavor and needed more salt. I also thought it would come with sausage because it said it had meat in it but I didn't see any meat. The biscuit, no complaints. It was honestly really good. I would go back just for the biscuit."

I vomited hours after eating bad fried chicken for dinner, I knew it was the chicken because my wife had mashed potatoes and mac and cheese (she's vegetarian) and she was fine. I had an upset stomach all day long afterwards. I hope they revisit sanitary and hygiene measures after this review. It's extremely rare for me to get this stomach sick so it must have been something really bad in the food. The sides (cornbread, biscuit, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and spinach) were good."

        "Brian N.": "Being a fan of Brenda's French Soul Food and soul food in general, I was glad to see Brenda's M&T on my food delivery app.  Going against my own rules for food delivery, which is avoiding deep fried food for places further than 5 mins away, I went ahead and ordered their signature fried chicken. I opted for thighs and a breast piece on the side. The chicken was tender and crunchy even after a 15 minute delivery! Flavor-wise, I think it was a little underwhelming. Maybe because I had high expectations, but it did not stand out compared to other sit down fried chicken restaurants I've been to. My actual review is 4.5 stars and there is a .25 deduction for this. Definitely worth trying and fried very well though. For sides, I went with the mac n' cheese and red beans & rice. The mac n' cheese tasted like it was a family recipe that has been perfected over time. Very good quality cheese, mac had a nice bite, and looked carefully made. I am usually hesitant to order mac n' cheese because most places prepare it like they are making it for an elementary school cafetaria - processed or powdered cheese with overcooked mushy pasta. Anytime I return, this will certainly be ordered. The red beans & rice were OK. This one was a little plain to me and I would probably try another side next time so the other .25 deduction is from this item. Possibly tasted bland because it was being held up against the stellar mac n' cheese and the next item coming up...  The biggest star of the meal was the cream biscuit! This alone makes me want to come back. It is by far the best biscuit I have had locally and when combined with their hand crafted jams, it is a home run. My first bite of this was eye opening and I have since been recommending Brenda's M&T just for this item. In fact, I have come back twice since and always order two of these. Overall, great SF gem. Hits and misses, but the hits are grand slams and the misses are still good. You can tell a lot of love and care has been put into these recipes and their preparation. I look forward to trying more items on the menu!"

        "Michael U.": "Well aware that Brenda's French Soul Food was a growing concern with an ever-expanding queue it was in 2014 that owner Brenda Buenviaj teamed up with restaurateur Andre Larzul to open a second concept, the idea of a \"Meat & Three\" hatched from Buenviaj's Southern upbringing and an idea novel to The Bay. Quite literally one Meat and three Side Dishes from a daily menu, though some of Brenda's classics made their way over to a constant list including famous Fried Chicken that is spiced to the Bone beneath golden Batter, guests are also smart to order Gumbo made the proper way with Okra, Andouille, Shellfish and assertive dark Roux. Odd in terms of service, the waitress quite lovely while a man confirming reservations behind Plexiglass was confrontational to more than one party, sides found Fries outpacing Slaw and frankly-dry Cornbread though the oversized Biscuits were weighty and soft. Open all day Wednesday through Monday, both Breakfast and Lunch served till 3pm, Brenda's famous Beignets are unchanged from Polk Street, though dollar-for-dollar and bite-for-bite the best dish on this morning was thick Sweet Potato Pancakes liberally covered in a Sauce of melted Pralines."

After you complete your noodles, they will also come back and top up your remaining soup with hot water so you can drink the rest (without it being too thicc)!

I didn't see any vegan/vegetarian options, which felt very odd for a ramen restaurant in SF and specifically for a restaurant in the Mission, so I skipped it. But now, They've added 2 vegan appetizers and 2 vegan ramen bowls to the menu. I came here with a friend to try it out. I ordered the cucumber green miso chili appetizer and the Shimeji Miso ramen. The cucumber is fresh and the sauce is lightly sweet and spicy. The ramen has fresh buckwheat noodles, which you can see them make in-house. The bowl has a well-rounded flavor of umami from the miso and mushroom and vibrancy from the veggies. I really enjoyed adding their chili powder to add a spicy kick Overall, it's an enjoyable bowl though when it comes to vegan ramen, the competition is fierce in the city. Maybe one day, they'll come out with a veggie Tsukemen option!"

I thought the dashi broth was too sweet for my liking but some may like it.  My friend opted for the yuzu shio ramen which she enjoyed. Wish there were more vegetarian options on the menu!

Tokusei Tsukemen: cold thick buckwheat noodles and rich dipping soup made with pork, chicken, dried anchovy, and dried bonito. Served with pork chashu (2 kinds), soft boiled egg, menma, nori seaweed, and green onion. Probably one of the top tsukemen bowls I've had, absolutely delicious! It comes with two large pieces of meat, a beautifully runny egg, and tons of chewy noodles. I usually can't finish my noodles, but I made it a point to finish these because they were just that good. The broth is flavorful without being too heavy, and at the end they pour hot dashi broth into it so you can enjoy it as a finishing palette cleanser. PARKING: Located on busy street in Mission District, so limited street parking available with paid lots nearby. SERVICE: Servers were attentive to our needs despite how busy the restaurant was. ATMOSPHERE: Nice Japanese restaurant in the middle of Mission with a good amount of space. Lots of tables and counter seating though gets busy during peak hours.  My friend and I were walking through the Mission and found this place along the way. We decided to stop here for dinner and were immediately seated at 6 PM on a Saturday, but there were already lines of people outside by 6:30 PM. We both tried the tsukemen and really enjoyed it!

Despite the crowd, customers are constantly streaming in and out given how efficient the service is.  - Tsukumen: The dipping broth was thick, warm, and comforting on a very cold SF evening. It comes topped with generous portions of meat and some slices of bamboo. My friend and I were surprised about the slightly herbal taste! Noodles were thick, chewy, and perfect.  - Spicy Ramen: My favorite, but only by a margin! The broth is spicy and hot -- enough to have you reaching for water but not enough to kill you -- and the thin ramen noodles were the perfect texture. Would totally come back to try their other ramen dishes. :)"

Also serving it hot on a paper plate made the parm stick to the plate when it cooled quickly outside and we kinda ate a bit of... paper plate! We also got the vege lasagna and this was very good. But just had higher expectations overall especially in North Beach."

        "Erica K.": "On a cold day, I was craving something warm and cozy and the pasta at The Italian Homemade Company was the perfect solution! We ordered: Pesto Pappardelle Bolognese Tagliatelle Once you order and pay at the register, you're given a number where you can pick your own seating with a water station on the side. While the pasta was good and tasted more buttery than saucy, because everything is fast casual they serve everything on paper plates where you end up racing against the clock because if you're a slow eater, the pasta will stick to the paper plate. I would come back to try their other sauce & pasta combinations and the vegetarian ravioli!  P.S. make sure to fully close the door when you're on your way out, saw the manager actively going out of her way to close it when people left, and I think the norm for some versus going the extra mile for others can make a difference in one's day!"

They had both inside seating and heated outside seating which was a big plus. We decided on the fresh air option. They had a good selection of fresh pastas. I decided to get fresh fettuccine and added meatballs. They give you a nice serving of pasta and meatballs. The meatballs were tender and flavorful. My buddy decided to try the flatbread with meatballs but had selection remorse. He liked the meatballs but thought the flatbread selection would be more flavorful. They give you fresh bread which we liked too. Even with all of the choices in North Beach, I'll definitely go again and try one of the other fresh pastas or lasagna."

I got the tagliatelle bolognese with meatballs, just because you so rarely see meatballs at a nice place like this. The portions were so generous and so rich! The outdoor seating was lovely on a sunny day, and the food gave me the mid-day refuel that I needed to enjoy all the sightseeing I could handle. Definitely go here. It's great!!"

We got lucky and found parking right outside the shop. We were also lucky that it wasn't packed and that we had found a table to sit in and eat. The place is small so I recommend you coming here early just in case or even do take out. The food was pretty good. I had gotten the fettuccine with Salsa Parmagiano while my gf got the vegetarian ravioli with the same sauce. My noodles were a little bit over cooked but the sauce made up for it. It was creamy and still light. My gf's ravioli was very good too and we both loved the spinach that was inside. The meatballs were a little too oily for me but it was still very tasty. The service was fast and the food came out steaming hot.  Even though the prices are high, I believe it's worth it. Definitely worth the 4 stars!"

        "Debby N.": "This is a no-frills Italian food restaurant, casual dining at its finest. If you're wanting a quick fix to your Italian craving, this place does not disappoint!  It's super casual and opposite of an Olive Garden or Maggiano's based on what the interior looks like. Literally they serve you pasta on compostable paper plates! There is dining space but it's not very suitable for large groups. I suggest groups of 4 are good and couples can easily find a spot to eat. The furniture was kinda wobbly and I almost thought I was going to fall off the stool, so be careful. They do also have dining outside but might be chilly.  Order before getting a number and finding a seat. Their menu is quite simple. I heard their salads and breads are good but I just wanted pasta. First I chose the type of pasta noodle I wanted then I added which sauce! I chose the tagliatelle with pesto and my hubs chose the pappardelle with bolognese sauce. We also added two meatballs to try! The cashier asks you if you want cheese on top of your pasta. I like that you can watch the chefs cook your pasta meal right in front of you.  The tagliatelle were medium width - not too wide and not too thin to my liking! The noodles itself were cooked al dente. The bolognese sauce was very meaty and my hubs enjoyed it. I think the star of our meal were the meatballs though because of how it melted in your mouth. You can tell they've been simmering the meatballs for a while and drenched in this tomato sauce. They were large and we cut each meatball into fourths. Perfect to share!  I know it's easy to say \"I could've made this meal myself at home\" but there are a handful of people (including me) who haven't handmade pasta before or made my own sauce or meatballs soo... this place definitely deserves some recognition as a solid Italian fast food place!  Service was quick and friendly! To be honest they kept to themselves (which I prefer anyway) and we were in and out in less than 40 minutes!  I'm looking forward to trying their gnocchi and lasagna in the future.  Parking- we got lucky and found a metered spot right in front. I suggest going on Sundays when the meters are free!"

The ambiance and smell of the food wafting from Flores drew us in, and I am so glad we gave it a try. The interior of the restaurant felt very upscale, but the prices were super reasonable. I had the flautas and the chicken enchiladas, and I was not disappointed. The flautas were perfectly crispy, and the chorizo/bean mixture inside was super flavorful. Add in the side of green salsa provided and you have a 5/5 appetizer - SO good. The enchiladas to follow for the main kept the heat coming - the level of spice was perfect, and the sauce that came with the dish was super addicting. I can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu items that caught my eye, like the carne asada and tacos.  The drinks were also solid - I had a strawberry margarita and have no complaints there. Service was excellent up until the check (we had to wait a while to flag our server down for that), but all in all, amazing experience and I can't wait to come back!"

We showed up when we got the text and had a 10 minute wait for our table.  Once our party of 5 were seated, it was 10-15 minutes until a server ever came by to bring waters and menus. I get it's extremely busy, but if we have menus we can take some time and decide instead of just sitting there. My boyfriend and I ordered a selection of 6 tacos as well as some other entrees to split with our party. The tacos were delicious! We got a mix of carnitas, colorado, chicken tinga, and pescado. The corn tortilla was by far the best corn tortilla I've had.  We split the following entrees: - Guacamole - Carnitas - Chicken Tinga - Churros  Guacamole is really basic. Carnitas and chicken tinga were good. Churros were so yum!! For me, I would come back and get tacos only next time!  Service could definitely be improved, but the food was great!"

The Mol was also very good, though I forgot to get a picture. The drinks really impressed me the most as they were original, unique, and very delicious! My favorite one was with Cabernet and tequila, not a mix you would expect, but it was delicious. The service was also incredible! Our servers made sure to check on us often, and we got our food on time. The only complaint I would have is that we were sitting at a hightop near the kitchen, also close to the door, and it was pretty cold. We all had to keep our coats on the entire time even though we were sat inside next to the kitchen, I thought this would be a safe spot since kitchens are usually quite hot, but we were all very chilly. That sometimes cannot be helped if the door hasta be open and it's cold outside but that's my only complaint here."

        "Dina G.": "Enjoyed very tasty cocktails. I recommend a vodka Paloma.  The guacamole is heaven! Nice and fresh tasting and limey.  The chips also are crispy and fresh.  The ceviche is in a thin red sauce, yummy and flavorful.  The enchiladas seemed small for the price. My partner enjoyed them.  The Chile Relleno was tender and flavorful. The sauce wasn't spicy for me and I thought it was super yummy. However, the stuffing of the pepper was disappointing. I was expecting cheese, spinach and mushroom. The majority of the stuffing was large chunks of onion, which were overpowering. I couldn't eat a single bite without having to pick hunks of onions out of my mouth. Luckily my partner either loves me enough not to care or was already drunk. There was also an entire clove of garlic buried in there. If onions and whole cloves of garlic aren't your thing, I might skip the pepper. (Or ask if they can make the stuffing without onions?) Aside from the abundance of alliums, it was quite nice.  At 9pm on a rainy Tuesday, the ambiance was nice, servers great. I would go back."

This place is a classier restaurant for Mexican food. It is still casual but has an upscale vibe. We were seated in the middle and honestly can't stress how amazing the interior is. For food we got the flautas and enchiladas and both were amazing dishes. The tortillas are just crispy enough to bite into yet soft on the inside. The flautas had a killer green salsa that balances out the chorizo and beans. The chicken in the enchiladas were not very seasoned but it had so much flavor from the salsa and cheese alone that it did not matter. The drinks are tequila and mezcal forward and are certainly worth trying. Service was a little slow like getting a table and getting the bill but still friendly and helpful and social. Overall a great location for an intimate dinner or friendly gathering and I would absolutely recommend coming out even just trying their happy hour."

Definitely felt a nice buzz from the pitcher alone.  For food we started with the queso fundido, which was not my fav. First off there wasn't as much cheese as I would expect, just a top layer, and big pieces of onion and mushroom. Staff knew we weren't a huge fan, and made it right, which is much appreciated.  For the main, we decided to go with the 6 taco plate. Presentation wise, loved it. The tortillas you can tell were hand made, although I wish they grilled em a bit longer. The only taco I really enjoyed with the fried fish one. The carnitas and Colorado meAt were both on the drier side.  My friend made a reservation through Yelp the night before and the staff was able to accommodate us running 15 minutes late. From a customer service stand point, this place was 5-stars all around. Everyone was polite and attentive and open to feedback about the dishes which is good. If you are looking for good margaritas and tasty fish tacos, they do that really well here. Definitely the top two things I'd go back for. The ambiance makes this a great spot for date night."

Each item is distinct and so flavorful.You can taste the authenticity. I could eat this for days. - Chicken Tibs: delicious! the sauted onions and jalapeos really set it off. I love eating the injera underneath that soaks up all the spices - Sambussa: perfectly flaky crust stuffed with well seasoned lentils and the spicy tomato based dip is a perfect pairing.

        "Emily Y.": "This was my first time trying Ethiopian food and enjoyed it.  -Location: meter/pay by license plate street parking only, close to public transportation (T train)  - Casual restaurant: order at the counter, and they give you a number and bring the number to your table, and they bring the food to you. They have a self-serve water station to the right of the counter by the wall. There are lots of seating (indoor + outdoor), family friendly. Clean, separate women and men's restrooms.  - Service: There was only one person managing everything in the front, so it took a while to place an order.  I ordered the vegetarian combo ($15.90), which is a sampler plate of 5 veggie entrees (below) over injera. My friend ordered the beef mushroom tibs, and that had a lot of stir fry flavor and spicy kick, similar to the misir wot. We each got one injera on the side which was the perfect amount to go with the entrees. Its tastes like a spongey sourdough crepe, went perfectly my meal.  The veggie combo consisted of: -kik alicha wot (chickpeas cooked with mild turmeric, onions, garlic, and jalapeos): least favorite, could have used more seasoning  -misir wot (spicy split lentil sauce made with berbere, onions, garlic, and ginger): MY FAVORITE! Mild spicy kick, packed with tons of flavor. -gomen (collard greens sauted with onions, garlic, and jalapeos): good, non spiciy but lots of liquid -alicha tikil gomen (fresh cabbage, potatoes, and carrots cooked with turmeric sauce of onions, garlic, and ginger): good, light flavor -key sir wot (fresh beets and potatoes cooked with onions, tomatoes, garlic, and jalapeos): good as well, sweetness of the beets shines through. *On the menu, it said the entrees would be served with salad, azifa, and buticha; however, neither my friend nor I got the side of azifa and buticha.  Would return if in the area for the misir wot!! *forgot to take a picture, but the serving size is like the other pictures. It was surprisingly very filling."

Just stunning We ordered the beef tibs and chicken tibs dishes. The meal was served with a choice of a side as well as the Ethiopian bread. Loved the flavors in the dishes we ordered and the side on collard greens was soft and nicely seasoned. The side of the lentils was great as well.

We got home in 10 mins. Everything tastes pretty fresh. The pancake came in twos - which was very gracious of them to provide. The meats were lamb and beef with some split peas and greens.

I ordered it with the kik alicha side option and it was small. I understand since it's just the side. But keep that in mind if you're looking for a full portion of kik alicha.  My buddies ordered beef tibs with alicha tikil gomen, and the tikil gomen entree.  The beef tibs tasted like they're cooked in the same spices as tofu tibs. Spicy and yummy. Good option if you're in the mood for meat, but if u get the tofu you won't be missing out. The tikil gomen could've used more spices imo, so I'm glad I chose the kik alicha instead.  Injera was sooo soft and spongey. Delicious. My friend forgot to request gluten free injera and the owner kindly brought over a basket for her instead. And although the gluten free injera looks darker/ less soft than the regular one, it tasted the same! So that's a plus for GF folks.  I'd come back for the tibs and injera, and try other veggie options. Kik alicha was a tad watery than I expected but still good."

Of course the \"new\" drink was equally horrible but in the conversation with the server it was revealed that most of their cocktails are premade and are put in cold storage. Thats a major red flag for me 3rd incident we were yet to order main courses and the staff started quickly clearing out the menus from our table. When i suggested that we r yet to order main course, I get a strange and weird reaction which all 4 of us noticed. Not gonna visit this place again unless staff goes through serious hospitability training after which i might go just for the food"

We were seated in the office hall area which was a little odd - but there were many tables near us so we didn't feel to isolated. For appetizers we got the Pav Bhaji Puff, the Pani Puri, and the Kachori Dumplings. These were all pretty delicious!! Small serving sizes though.  For mains, we got the Black Sheep Lamb (Vegan) Curry (has imitation meat), Eggplant Dish, Okra curry, and Palak Paneer - all were decent but nothing special. Our order also took a loooong time to come out. For breads/sides, we got the cheese naan, roti, and rice. The sunflower seed cheese naan was waay too cheesy - little difficult to eat. Overall, I think I would have enjoyed my time here if we were seated in the main area + if i could try other entrees on the menu. I would have also enjoyed if we had a little bit more of a hospitable experience - sitting in the side hall made it feel like we were not in the restaurant/not greeted properly."

        "Aishwarya P.": "I had been hearing so much buzz about Besharam, an upscale restaurant, that I finally decided to give it a try with a group of friends. Unfortunately, a few things stood out in a negative sense that made our experience less enjoyable than we expected. Firstly, if you are a group of six or more, you are required to choose the prefix menu, which is limited and doesn't give you the freedom to select dishes that you prefer. As a result, our total bill came out to be around $900, which seemed quite steep considering the quantity and quality of food that we received. Moreover, the service tax is 20% irrespective of the number of diners in your group, so be sure to keep that in mind if you visit this place. Moving on to the food, we were not particularly impressed. The portions were small, and the taste was average at best. Given the high price we paid per person, it felt like we were eating homemade food that shouldn't cost $70 per person. To add to our disappointment, we were seated outside in an art gallery, which felt quite random and not particularly conducive to a memorable upscale dining experience. Although the decor and ambiance were nice inside the restaurant, our seating arrangements did not live up to our expectations. Overall, while the brand and decor of Besharam may seem impressive, the food and service did not match up to their reputation. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for an upscale and memorable dining experience, especially considering the high prices and limited menu options in the prefix menu. I'm a little hesitant to be back and try the a la carte menu."

We had called to simply ask if it was possible. He was so abrasive. This is the pure and sheer example of brown run establishments that cater to non-brown people only and the second they see their own kind, brown people, they become demeaning. I'll think about my review and see if I want to add the rest of the stars. This ruined my evening. We had long flights all day and drove quite a bit for this! We ended up getting bar seats and the bartender saved the night. He was hilarious and gave us drink samples. He ended up giving me a Parle G cookie and I almost cried. Short Stack, you're going places!  Food - smaller portions but shareable. Super creative items! Fully vegetarian. Mango Lassi slapped!!! Pauva salad was an upgraded Spicy Soft Potato taco.

I prefer the pani to be a little sweeter, but the overall dish was still good. Kachori Dumplings: Must try! Amazing blend of sweet chutney on top and savory filling.  Pav Bahji Puff: Soft pastry and great flavor of the filling. Dahi Wada: Also a must try! Malai Kofta: My favorite of the night. Texture was incredible, and everything melted in my mouth. Must try! Masak Paneer: I've never had paneer like this-- fresh and made in house. Amazing!  Cheesy garlic naan: Best cheesy naan I've had ever. Get this! Roti: Loved the mouthfeel of this-- the texture is not entirely smooth due to the added spices. Shrikhand Cheesecake: I love cheesecake so this was a no brainer for me to order. I wish I ordered another one, but unfortunately I was too full.  The interior of the restaurant is modern and clean. Service is great, and our server was so attentive and offered great suggestions.

Chef Heena Patel made a lot of amazing authentic dishes with her personal twist on it from her childhood growing up. (She was also super sweet, we said hello to her at the end!)  To start, the drinks were phenomenal!! One even came with parleg biscuit! Brought back so many childhood memories Everything that the way to recommended for us was really good! One dish that caught me off surprise was the mango salad- it was actually full of flavor, and really refreshing and phenomenal!!! I wasn't expecting that at all. The one dish I wish I didn't get was the meatballs - this might be a personal take but I personally don't love the taste of impossible meat, so I wasn't a biggest fan of this, but everything else was really good.  Their rotis and naans were reallllly fresh!"

I was blown away by how much meat they give you!  Their Kobe beef donburi looked delicious. I was told the lamb skewers were good. I tried the asari ramen and it was great. You get a generous amount of clams. I highly recommend the panko egg.  Parking was very easy to find. Very slow around 1pm."

They were tasted tender on one side and tough(like beef jerky) on another side.  Not busy at all during lunch time."

        "Jake T.": "TLDR: Creative, heavy, unapologetic, not-your-parents-ramen. Good stuff. Saturday 12/19/23 ~1:06pm, $25.73 after tip Immediately seated. 6 min 30 sec order-to-bowl ~~~~~~~~~ Jaeger Ramen ~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 7.84/10 (7.7/10) Noodles: Slightly thicker-than-average wavy egg noodles. These are standard \"Ramen Shop\" quality. The noodles were well cooked, chewy, with just enough bite. They held up well to the very rich/oily broth. Sourced from a quality noodle distributor. Executes its role well. (8.4/10) Broth: An incredibly rich, thick, and creamy curry-based broth. The curry-base was southeast asian inspired (coconut vs. Japanese style) and included all the bits (carrot, potatoes) from their main curry dish. The mild spicy oily helped to cut through all the richness. This stick-to-your-ribs.broth; its heavy. Eating this at lunch time will likely end you day. Incredibly flavorful. Creative. Unapologetic. Good. (6.7/10) Egg: Their famous Panko Egg left points on the table. The crispy deep-fried exterior was a great twist on traditional ramen topping. The added texture and and flavor of the breading was a welcome addition. Unfortunately, the egg itself was completely unseasoned. The cook (soft-boiled) was fine; pretty impressive considering the extra deep-fired cooking step. This egg has the potential to enter GOAT status. If only the base-egg was soaked in a strong shoyu-style marinade... What could have been. (8.4/10) Meat: Four Cumin lamb skewers. These skewers delivered on flavor. There was a underlying sweet, almost teriyaki base-flavor with a nice coating of their cumin sauce. These skewers would be great as a standalone side-dish or a main-meat on top of some rice. The only drawback was some excess chewiness, but YMMV. Great topping. (8.1/0) Misc Topping: Following the ethos ot the bowl \"No filler here\". The fried \"birds nest\" was the extra decadence in an already packed bowl. The crunchiness, texture, and deep-fried flavor will always hit. No room for bean sprouts, mushrooms, or anything that doesn't pack a punch, (7.4/10) Other: The fundamentals of the bowl are incredibly strong. The broth alone could send you into a post-food coma. Every component in the bowl has to carry its weight in the flavor department, not to be oushined by any of the other \"maxed out\" ingredients. Some days you may want a relatively light shio-ramen; other days you need the Jaeger to beat your taste buds into submission. *Weighted Scoring Formula: Noodles (25%), Broth (25%), Egg (15%), Meat (15%), Misc Top. (10%), Other (10%) Other: Bathrooms: single gender neutral bathrooms. Parking: Street parking. Easy on a Sunday/holiday. Service: Run by a single server. Efficient. No complaints."

I had the Karaage Ramen, with huge pieces of chicken, fried to perfection then covered with a curry aioli sauce. The broth was a rich and hearty miso, which paired well with the al dente curly noodles.  The K.O. broth had a deep pork bone broth taste, not as fatty and paired with 3 different versions of pork. I tried some pork belly and it was perfect. Other tables ordered the impressive lobster and shrimp ramen, which we might try next time. I really enjoyed the ramen here and left extremely full."

I was seated immediately and service was friendly; took my order quickly. I got the gyoza app and karaage ramen; the gyoza (they come with 5) were yummy but pretty standard. Not sure if I would order again, for that price. The ramen was huge, looked very extravagant - they do NOT skimp on the protein here, which is great. I should have asked for it on the side; some of it got soggy in the broth and that made it much less enjoyable to eat. Curry aioli was good but ended up messing the broth up a bit imo. Broth had good heat to it, and the noodles had that perfect, chewy springiness to it. Portion is definitely sizable! The chicken was a little cold in places, they maybe hadn't heated it while making the ramen? No idea. But would deduct a star for that. Prices are maybe slightly higher but still on brand for San Francisco. I would come back!"

He ate it all up but noted it tasted just like the Shin Black ramen package. If that's the case, don't know if it was necessarily worth paying $14.95.  We also ordered the:  1) Kimchi Jigae - more than enough for 3 people with plenty to take home. Probably my fave dish. Very flavorful and definitely has a kick.  2) Kalbi - can never go wrong with kalbi  3) Kimchi Cheese Pancake - every table seemed to have ordered one version of the pancake and I can see why. They're huge, crispy, and flavorful. One of the better ones I've had.  4) Chicken - hubs can never pass up fried chicken. Couldn't decide on a flavor so went 1/2 sweet and spicy and 1/2 sweet garlic. Definitely crispy. Flavors of both were good but I think I like the sweet garlic one more.  Everything we ordered was good. Prices might be high but portions were decently sized.

Kimchi pajun w/ the melted cheese was also delish and wonderful. Everything else was good, but they're standard flavors and can be found in most KoreanSpots in the city. Banchan, I wish had more options, but it was fine. Good service, no frills: you ask they deliver, no small talk...sometimes that's all you need. We'll be back if we're ever on Noriega St again!

The Budae-Jjigae was enough to serve everyone a decent-sized bowl, but the portion of Galbi-jjim did not seem worth its price of ~$50.  Taste was great though! I really liked the hint of sweetness of the Galbi-jjim dish and the pancake was delicious too! Budae-jjigae was just perfect for a cold night.  Service was pretty good and overall, loved the aesthetics. I do regret that there was no Wifi or service at all in the restaurant so I was not able to browse through Yelp or share my experiences at the restaurant while I was there."

        "Brian F.": "4.5 stars I found this place on a whim since we were going to be in the area after dinner. I called to make a reservation when they opened for 8pm on a Friday night and it was mostly empty when we arrived. It was way more packed at around 9-10pm. SEAFOOD PANCAKE ($21.95) - I didn't expect the seafood pancake to be this good but it was. The bottom was way crispier compared to other pancakes that I've had elsewhere. It was thick and not flimsy but also chewy at the same time. The sauce was a great complement too. 5/5 KIMCHI FRIED RICE ($15.95) - My first thought when eating this was that I needed to infiltrate the restaurant and force them to give me the recipe. I make kimchi fried rice at home and this (obviously) blew that out of the water. I couldn't tell you exactly why this was so good, but it just hit different. This was my favorite dish. 5/5 KALBI JIM ($54.95) - The beef was tender and fell apart super easily. It was on the pricier side given the portions but was not bad. Also, always get the cheese (+$2) if you can. 4/5 ASSORTED CHICKEN WINGS ($21.95) - You can get assorted chicken pieces or all chicken wings. You can also do half and half for $2 more. We got the sweet and spicy and the sweet garlic and I liked the former more. The chicken was good although I would've preferred all chicken wings since some pieces didn't have as much meat. 3.5/5 The service was pretty good overall mostly because we arrived and got our food before it got really busy. I ate some of the best kimchi fried rice and seafood pancakes that I've ever had here which was not something I expected but was a pleasant surprise. Good to know that if I'm ever back in SF I have a go-to Korean spot."

The servers are super nice and quick! Very attentive to their customers (providing updates on orders, asking if they need anything, providing more water). I would definitely come back here if I'm craving Korean food! There's plenty of street parking a block or two away (and trust me after your meal, you won't mind walking the extra blocks back to your car since you'll be stuffed!) We've ordered: Budae Jigae - spicy stew with ramen, veggies, tofu, spam... SOOO good! This definitely feeds 4 people! we always have to bring half back home Ribeye bulgogi - love how the meat is thinly sliced so the meat isn't super chewy!

They had a long menu with lots of options, so I opted for the soft tofu soup and to share the fried chicken with the table. The fried chicken was crispy and flavorful, though I expected either diced chicken or a significantly greater portion for the price. Still enjoyed it! But it was maybe only 2-3 more pieces than the wings without more desirable cuts, so it didn't make sense for it to be that much more expensive.  The soft tofu soup was hot and bubbly on arrival but didn't wow me in flavor and comfort as other Korean restaurants have provided. Overall the food was good just not great and for a moderate-to-high price range given its rather removed location."

When we were leaving they noticed I had more soup left so they gave me an extra bowl of rice to go. The food was amazing. The tofu soup came out boiling hot so the egg was was nicely cooked. The porkbelly was well seasoned and came with some side sauces- soy bean paste and salt pepper sesame oil. So so so good. There was also purple rice that I loved. The side dishes were amazing. Came with kitchen, broccoli, a apple salad, fish cake. My favorite is the fish cake. Would definitely come back to this spot because it was amazing."

        "Mito I.": "Brief summary: - Near the entrance, there is a place to order sweets like baklava or Turkish delights - Wait time felt long We walked from Japantown to have lunch here. Near the window, it displayed different selections of sweets like Turkish delights and baklava. We sat inside and ordered three dishes. Two were avocado toasts and mine was the shakshuka. The three of us shared casual talks and whatnot, but despite the talking it felt like a while for our dishes to arrive. We had a moment of pause and one asked, \"hmm, it's late isn't it?\" I don't think the three of us are impatient, but I also agree that it might have taken more than 15 minutes for our food to arrive at our plates. Once it did, I got to try the shakshuka for the first time. Embarrassed to say, I wasn't sure what is the best way to eat the dish. I decided to mix the egg and the avocado within the tomato sauce and scoop the tomato sauce into the flat naan like bread. I left the orange last because I treated that as dessert. This dish was light because it contained mostly vegetables. I did feel like the sauce got salty near the end, when I ran out of the bread to scoop it up with. I think what I should have done is mix the avocado and egg further to make a creamier texture. I got to try the avocado toast and that was pretty good. The bread was thick and there was slices upon slices of avocado on top. They ordered a variant of the avocado toast, that comes with a layer of cooked egg. It was fluffy and created a rounder flavor to the bread and avocado. The knife was indeed helpful in cutting the bread in a few pieces to eat easier."

To start, we ordered a selection of appetizers that included the Turkish Spiced Fries, Organic Chickpea Falafel, Hummus, Tzatziki & Muhamara, and Baked Eggplant. Each dish was full of flavor and expertly prepared, showcasing the authentic and delicious cuisine that Troya is known for. For the main course, my friend ordered the Lamb Skewers and raved about how good they were. As a vegetarian, I was pleased with the variety of options available and enjoyed my selections immensely. To cap off our meal, we decided to indulge in dessert and ordered the Chef Alex's Lava Cake, Pistachio Baklava, and LOKUM (traditional Turkish delights). While the Lava Cake was not as impressive as we had hoped, the Pistachio Baklava and LOKUM were truly exceptional, with the perfect balance of flaky phyllo, honey, and nuts.

The Turkish brunch sampler for 2 ($60) is definitely something to share and write home about, especially if you're a fan of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine.  My favorite items from the sampler included the green olives with red seasoning sprinkled on top, fresh tomato/cucumber, tahini with sesame seeds and almost a creamy peanut butter dessert consistency, dried dates and walnuts (try dipping the date in the tahini at the end of your meal as a sweet treat), and both cheeses. Our server let us know that one cheese is a feta and the other is a harder, more-aged version, and that both included a combination of three types of milk - cow, goat, and sheep. This definitely made the cheese easier to digest, and I personally recommend putting the feta on the shakshuka.  The Shakshuka was also good but felt like it could have been great if we had eaten this immediately because the eggs seem to continue cooking the longer you let it sit. I do wish that the lamb sausage either was mixed into the sauce so that the sauce absorbed the flavor, or that the lamb sausage was cooked for less time so that it was less crispy. It comes with slices of lamb but as of now these seem like they could be easily removed if you're vegetarian.  If you order extra bread, heads up that it is an additional $10, but since they bring you an entire tray of different bread types it feels worth it. The Turkish coffee ($5) is worth trying at least once if you enjoy super strong tasting coffee, or if you're just an adventurous person. It also comes served in a cute cup and saucer with a little treat on the side. For those wanting a regular coffee ($3.50) with their brunch, not to fear because they have this as well."

The dumplings themselves were flavorful and cooked just the right amount, but they were drowning in liquid. Also, the food came out so quickly that it made us a little sus.  I do have to say the giant log plate the chicken skewers came on was somehow very appealing to me. I mean, who doesn't want to eat their food on a cross section of a tree?

As a Greek Armenian I was surprised to see moussaka on the menu , and though it was not how I was used to, it tasted amazing and we gobbled it up.  The Turkish spiced fries I highly recommend the chipotle sauce was amazing with it.  The appetizers combo is a MUST to get, the muhamara was probably the best out of the 3 it was so addicting. The braised lamb was so good and I'm a vegetarian (LOL) I never order meat intentionally but we got it and I enjoyed it. Even the rice was good ! The pilaf on the moussaka was good too I recommend everything we got if you're trying Mediterranean food for the first time. Baklava wasn't good to be honest, but the kunefe was pretty good. Both needed more of the simple syrup/rose water syrup on it but the baklava just felt dried. Probably better coming here in the morning when they make it fresh. Next time I come to SF I will definitely come here to try the manti as I grew up on the dish.  Service was friendly and very servers were very professional even when making jokes they answered all of our questions. We felt taken care of and definitely not neglected.

While the kebabs were good, I don't think it's worth the price. It didn't taste seasoned or marinated. For me, it tasted like skewered unseasoned meat with vegetables.

One order of rice roll was almost $12 and an order of buns (3) was $8. If you don't want to do the math, I'll do it for you: that's $2.60 PER BUN, for a bun that's 1/3 the size of your palm. Bruh. The buns were fluffy and had tasty fillings. The rice rolls were pretty good (bamboo shoots were a nice touch). The egg yolk paste in the lava egg yolk buns was really good. Cold noodles surprisingly not a lot of flavor. Spicy and mala, but lacking in any savoriness. Also noodles were a doughy and just kind of dense, not QQ at all. And it cost almost $16. I think if the price of every dish was cut in half, I would consider coming back. Otherwise, there are just so many other cheaper, better options in SF to be going to."

        "Mari H.": "I was lured here with the promise of dumplings and Belgian beer one school night at about 8:30. Took a few minutes but we got in and shut the place down.  We grabbed some pork and veggie dumplings, eggplant and chicken, an order of kung pao chicken, and the hot and numbing fish. I grabbed a Dupont Saison, which pairs with spicy Chinese food amazingly! I've never done the Szechuan flavor before, and while it's a little overwelming on its, own, it was still really fun with other spicy dishes. The flavors are full and perfectly seasoned.  It's a little out of the way from the main restaurants in the Castro, but absolutely worth the extra trek!"

        "Shikha S.": "Good veggie-friendly Chinese food for the Castro! The wait on a Sunday afternoon confirmed it :)  Ambiance - classic fast casual restaurant, tile flooring and tables with regular dining chairs.  Service - like dim sum restaurants, you circle what you want and they bring it to you. A little hard to flag down the waiters to order something off the regular menu not on the dim sum menu, but very helpful and fast once ordered.  Food: We got the steamed vegetarian buns, veggie noodles with chili bean paste, the clay pot vegetables, and the Triple C tofu (we never did find out what each C meant ....) Noodles: well cooked noodles, very heavy (too heavy?) on sauce, rich in flavor, but wish it had more veggies/spice coming through.  Hot Pot: similar profiles as the sauce on the noodles, veggies/tofu cooked nicely and the mushrooms added a nice texture too Triple C Tofu: HIGHLY recommend - tofu was super nicely cooked, the outside was sweet/saucy/crispy, and the portion was a great size.  Overall, everything we ordered was saucy / sweeter / heavier that it all blended a bit in my head, but still yummy - steamed veggie buns were a nice palette cleanser! Def recommend finding other dishes on the menu if you're veggie / vegan than just the dim sum. On the pricier side as well!"

        "Michelle Z.": "A bit overrated and overpriced. Ordered the chongqing chicken, Chinese broccoli, and a bottle of the cheapest wine on the menu (gerwurtztraminer).  Pro: - buying a bottle of wine is cheap compared to most places. - Lots of chicken compared to most Chongqing chicken orders - milder usage of spices (good if you prefer those) Cons - The chongqing chicken wasn't typical to what you see of a Chongqing chicken order. Didn't have a lot of mala - you have to pay for rice - milder usage of spices (bad if you want more spice)"

I ordered from DoorDash and have to say that some photos were HUGELY inconsistent with the food. Still a lot of it was great. I'll go dish-by-dish: The best: --Hot and numbing fish: perfectly crispy fried fish with a spicy outer layer. Everyone's favorite --Cumin lamb: tender lamb with onions and green peppers, the meat was just really tasty --Shrimp stuffed eggplant: soft fried eggplant with shrimp filling --Crispy Eggplant: deep-fried eggplant. Not very distinctive (not much seasoning) but still a great add. These were all good/ok, not great but hard to mess up: --Dry fried green beans: this was not like other dry fried green beans, they were more soggy --Stir-fried pea leaves with garlic --Mother chen's bean curd (their version of mapo tofu) Bad:  These looked NOTHING like the photos, which was pretty disappointing.  --Beijing Style Chicken and Eggplant: The photo shows a more traditional garlic eggplant dish, this was extremely dry --Chongqing Chicken: this was red, in contrast with the photo and other dry-fried chicken I'd had. Very misleading and not good --Boiled Beef Slices in a Fiery Sauce: again, nothing like the photo. Very little spice and tasted more like a Chunkys beef strew... As a price reference, every dish was $20 except for crispy eggplant ($16) and the smaller shrimp-stuffed eggplant ($10, just ~4 pieces) Note: I couldn't add my full caption to the photo, here it is: Clockwise from top: Dry fried green beans, Beijing Style Chicken and Eggplant, Crispy Eggplant, Shrimp stuffed eggplant, Mother chen's bean curd, Chongqing Chicken, Boiled Beef Slices in a Fiery Sauce, Stir-fried pea leaves with garlic, Hot and numbing fish"

So I was very excited to see what the hype was all about when I made a reservation. Got there maybe 5 minutes before opening and there was already a line! So again, expectations were high.  For drinks, I got the \"sour milk\" cocktail. Sounds gross but it was delish! Staff was super friendly and were great at explaining the menu and providing recommendations. The menu seems to be seasonal so check out their website for the most up to date offerings. Food was decent, however, I didn't really think anything lived up to the hype. I found the menu selection to be small given that it was served tapas style with smaller portions. But maybe I just have a bigger than average appetite, so that's just a me problem lol.  I do gotta say the ambience is cool, every time I look at the decor I find something new and interesting to look at. Overall, not bad but not worthy of the long lines in my opinion. It's a fun place to grab some drinks and a small bite, but not the top on my list."

While it may be inspired this is Americanized Latin food. The portions are small, so price wise you feel your paying entree rates for tapas servings. Service was okay but non existent after the food came. Tortilla chips were on the hard side. Food wise it was okay, but simply average I what I could give it."

We waited in the outside seating area.  The food was so good. We got fish tacos, Brussels sprouts, empanadas, tacos tropical and the chips and salsa. Everything was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgood.fish&s=abe84c946f54f75c83cdb8d26b161e3ea40d8a770bf21b04e6462f52933e7700\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">good.fish</a> tacos were a good size. We thought we might need to order more food but it was not necessary. The fish was crispy with a sauce that was really flavorful. I'm allergic shrimp so I didn't try it but our friend said it was great. The empanadas had a nice crispy crust. The Brussels sprouts were a bit greasy but nothing a napkin didn't solve.

The menu offers a range of small plates, mains, and cocktails that are perfect for sharing with friends or indulging in solo. I highly recommend starting with the guacamole, which is made fresh to order and served with warm tortilla chips. The empanadas are another standout dish, with crispy pastry shells filled with savory meat and vegetables. For mains, the grilled steak is always a winner, cooked to perfection and served with flavorful chimichurri sauce. And don't forget to pair your meal with one of Lolo's signature cocktails. My favorites are the refreshing Paloma or the spicy Jalapeo Margarita. The service at Lolo is always friendly and attentive, making for an all-around enjoyable dining experience. Whether you're looking for a fun spot to catch up with friends over drinks and small plates, or a full meal of Latin American favorites, Lolo is definitely worth a visit."

We showed up right when they opened and they were gracious enough to give us a table for 3 for 1.5 hours. Thank you staff for your generosity in accepting walk-ins! We came here 1 time and based on this 1 time, I would give this place 4.5 stars (I know, most of you are like, \"bro, you so cheap with your stars, just round up!\" To which my response would be, \"I just can't bring myself to put 5 stars for most Yelpers to glance at because 5 stars to me is places like Benu. Sorry.) This is what we ordered: 1. Brussels sprouts 2. Prawn tempura 3. Umami sliders 4. Mamasan Cut Roll 5. CA Roll (for our daughter) 6. Unagi Sushi 7. Brownie Roll The stand outs for me: Prawn tempuras, which came out looking like a yakitori and love the nori tempura batter. Yuzu aioli was outstanding. Umami Sliders were great. The bun was moist and soft and it just ate well. It didn't fall apart and it was super tasty. Mamasan Cut Roll: Outstanding roll. This was probably the star. Unagi Sushi: Meaty, not fatty like you'd like at a cheaper restaurant. Eel to rice ratio was wonderful. The surprise of the night? That brownie roll. I mean, a layer of chocolate over the ice cream, cut in slices to look like a roll, chopped hazelnut on top....I dunno, call me bourgeois, it was delicious!!! Overall, a great meal.

We started with their Brussels sprouts, they were literally the best I've ever had(the bar has been raised yet again). Next we enjoyed their Kobe sliders but had to wait a bit because they originally brought out the wrong sliders, regardless of the delay, the flavor was all their and it was such a well rounded slider. The chicken gyoza, I found to be disappointing as they didn't have much flavor aside from the sauces. Lastly, the eel roll was good, but didn't exceed expectations by any means. The service felt slow at times but they were always friendly so no big deal. I would come back and get their Brussels sprouts and sliders for sure!"

But, it turned out okay since there were heaters outside. Funny enough, we saw a table for four empty during our time eating there, but it's fine lol. We ordered to share and I can't remember exactly what we got, but I do remember the TORO CAKES! Omg they were so good. I loved the tuna tartare + the crispy rice combo, and the truffle oil!!

The Toro Cakes were also delicious! It usually comes with three pieces but we were able to get a fourth piece so our entire group can have one.  We then ordered three rolls to share.

The particular spot itself has changed up a bunch over the years and this is a nice go-to since Woodhouse up the street has gone down in quality. Plenty of seating on a Saturday after 8pm - from the looks of it there were plenty of take-out and food delivery orders. Fish & Chips - Fresh and flaky, some of the pieces of haddock might have been under seasoned but one was perfectly seasoned. Awesome tartar sauce! Standard french fries. The Boston Style Clam Chowder in a Bread Bowl - nice and hearty chowder, well seasoned. The bread bowl itself is also seasoned (including the top!). The crust itself, while structured, was easy to tear and wasn't too hard like most generic bread bowls. Once the chowder was done we were able ot fold up the rest of the bowl to chow on.

Lobster roll(2.5/5): the sauce is way too sour, can't really taste the freshness of lobster meat, texture of lobster meat is so-so, they added green onions and lettuce ad carrot into the roll-- which makes it worse. Boston Clam Chowder(3/5) : Way too salty and too much spices added, again they covered the original taste of the chowder Crab cake (1.5/5): The fried dough on the too is too thick and is clearly overcooked. The flavors of crab were cooked to a point that was lost. All I taste is the tasteless crust and the spices in the crab cake. Fries (3.5/5): I rate it the highest but I'm not here for the fries. My tasting buds are subjective but I hope it provides some insights for people who consider to come and for improvements on the menu.

Food: Cup of Vegan Chowder - comes with a slice of toasted sourdough bread, super tasty full of corn, potatoes and other veggies. The coconut base with the spices used reminded me of a creamy coconut curry. Would totally order again. Boston Clam Chowder in a Bread Bowl - hearty with lots of clam pieces throughout. Spicier than I was expecting, perhaps some old bay being used. Overall tasty, but felt a little different than a classic clam chowder."

Fret not! They're back, and the bread is as perfect as ever! I have carried this bread to my neighbors when they are sick or even just sad. It's been left hanging at my door, a loving surprise waiting to welcome me home. I've brought a boule on countless journeys, a gift for hosts and folks I love, from my home to so many others around the world. The kids are definitely talking about something different, but trust me when I say, \"Let's get this bread!\"  This is the place I carefully budgeted to visit after landing in SF ages ago, when everything felt far too fancy for my self-employed salary. It's the place I saved for celebration. Now, it's the place I've brought visitors, new loves, and old friends to indulge and enjoy. It's my favorite three-block walk and my most frequent impulse-stop off Muni before my actual destination at the end of the N. They just brought dinner service back at the end of 2022, and it's been wonderful to return! I made a reservation for one to commemorate the occasion and got to chat with the original owner, who was there to support the former manager and new owner during that transition. They've always clearly taken good care of their crew, and that intention is still felt from my view across the bar, table, or parklet. Thank you, Outerlands.

The Cabernet also sweet and smooth. Mushroom risotto packed a good punch.l with flavor and texture. It's not cheap, our bill came out to ~ $80+.  The crowd vibe was chill: families, couples and friends catching up.  Their menu is definitely more catered for brunch. It looks amazing online. Debating if it's worth the 1-2hr wait I read here.

We found street parking a block away and walked to the restaurant.  SERVICE We arrived for a late lunch/brunch around 1:45PM. Surprisingly, there wasn't a wait at all. We did have to wait about 5-8 mins in line outside to order at the hostess stand before being given a number and assigned table. Their patio/outdoor seating area is pet friendly, which was PAWfect because we had our pups with us. The service was EXCELLENT. The hostess was super friendly and accommodating with our pups. The food and drinks came out quickly. We were checked on throughout our dining experience.  FOOD/DRINK *Trout Sandwich: beautifully displayed. This entree was everything I imagined. The smoked trout was delicious. Good balance with all of the ingredients: crme frache, cucumber, radish, pickled sweet onion and capers, which was refreshing on the palate. Recommend this dish! *Grilled Cheese: This grilled cheese was satisfying and filling. Good portion. Crunchy. Cheesy. Tasty!  *Chocolate Chip Cookie: we had to try it since it was recommended by the hostess. This cookie didn't disappoint! Crispy, chewy and gooey, yet the perfect size and thickness.  * Iced Lattes: fragrant and creamy. Strong espresso flavor.  It was our first time here and we throughly enjoyed everything. The service was what really nailed it for us. Bravo!"

        "Rochelle D.": "If you're looking for a brunch spot that's so hip it hurts, look no further than Outerlands in San Francisco. This place is the definition of \"farm-to-table,\" with ingredients so fresh they're practically still mooing. The atmosphere is cozy and rustic, with reclaimed wood and exposed brick walls that will make you feel like you're dining in a chic barn. Just don't be surprised if a stray hay bale rolls by - it's all part of the charm. The brunch menu is full of Instagram-worthy dishes that are almost too pretty to eat. The avocado toast is practically a work of art, and the ricotta pancakes will make you want to swear off IHOP forever. Just make sure you bring your appetite - the portions are more San Francisco-sized than Texas-sized. But let's be real - the real reason you're here is for the bottomless mimosas. And boy, do they deliver. The waitstaff practically hover over your table, ready to top off your glass the second it dips below half-full. Just make sure you pace yourself - too many mimosas and you'll be seeing double (and not just because of the trendy, hipster decor). Overall, if you're in the mood for a brunch that's more trendy than filling, Outerlands is the place for you. Just don't forget to bring your oversized sunglasses and your most Instagrammable outfit. Brunch never looked so good!"

        "Audrey A.": "Outerlands is a small restaurant located just outside of southwest quadrant of Golden Gate Park. My friend and I arrived and was told there was a brief wait. There was no notification system (e.g., text or beeper device), so we checked out a nearby shop and returned 20 minutes later. We came to check in for our table and were told we needed to wait in line to order our food before entering. This isn't a big deal but worth noting because the process was a bit confusing. After placing our order outside, we were taken to our seats. There was a slight mix up with the tables, but the issue was quickly resolved and did not impact the rest of our service. I enjoyed my two dishes, squash soup and mushroom toast. My favorite bites were spoonfuls of soup with sunflower seeds - it warmed me to the core on a chilly day. The toast was delicious as well with the freshness of the goat cheese and sweetness of the caramelized onions shining through. I am not much of a pancake fan (or sweetbread/pastry for that matter), but the small sample I had was good. My friend found the whole dish to be too sweet and tolerated eating 1/4 of the dish. She very much enjoyed the smashed potatoes. They were flavorful, esp with the aioli, however I wish there was a bit more of a crunch on the outside. The menu is not extensive, but everything we had was quality food. The seating/ordering procedure does a bit of a disservice to the customer service experience. Meaning, having no check-ins for quality assurance and overall happiness of the guests. It wasn't awful and this just may be based on a norm that may be changing. Personally, I chalked it up to being potentially short-staffed and this being the best way to efficiently turnover tables. This place is clearly very popular but the wait wasn't too long, so they are doing something right! FYI: There are two 5% charges (livable wage and health fees) added to you check that go to the staff"

They have outdoor seating with heaters on the side of the place and others with no heating.  1st: you have to order (outside) before you're sat 2nd: our drinks came 1/2 way through our meal. Service was disappointing and don't expect anyone to check on you once food is dropped off.  We ordered... Hot late: 7/10 nothing memorable and expresso was on the bitter side Hot tea: 7/10 green leaf (7.00 for tea, nothing special and wouldn't recommend) Fresh lemonade: 9/10 Dutch pancake: 8/10 sweet and savory needed some crme/syrup/powdered sugar (missing something to make it a 10) Mushroom toast: 9/10 overall the best tasting of what we ordered Breakfast sandwich with bacon: 7/10 lacked flavor, egg needed seasoning and is cooked over well  Overall, would have given more stars but because of service lacking and drinks coming nearly 1/2 way through our meal, stars is reflected."

Service was ok.  - Breakfast sandwich ($10) with bacon (+$3) - very good and love the arugula but portion was so small. - Roasted potatoes ($6) - got this to share and it was soo good! Comes with aioli sauce. - Dutch pancake - looks good but it was just ok, nothing special and the fruits were too tart. I preferred the french toast a bit better.  Overhyped. Food was just ok and nothing special. It's also overpriced for what it is."

The agenasu appetizer is a standout dish, with its crispy exterior and tender interior. The service at Hoshinoya was excellent as well.

You sign your name on the wait list sheet outside the restaurant. The inside of the restaurant is quite small so there's not much space to stand and wait.  I ordered the chicken karaage and tonkotsu ramen with chashu. Honestly, I was not impressed. The batter on the chicken karaage was hard to bite into and I've never had it like this. No sauce on the side to dip the chicken in and the flavor is on the bland side. Some chicken pieces tasted dry. Disappointing. The ramen was ok...nothing spectacular. I do like the soft boiled egg though!  Service was friendly and quick! Food was ok..overall 3.5 stars."

My brother got the basic Tokotsu option.  Tonkotsu shouyu was very nice in flavour. The chicken was very well cooked. The atmosphere is very nice. Very spacious with a lot of sunlight.

Service is fast and friendly and wait time has never been more than a few minutes."

        "Kristen B.": "3.5 stars, but I'll round up because my friend enjoyed her dish a lot! Came on a Friday lunchtime and it was only a short wait with one party in front of us. I HAD to get the Hoshi bun since Hoshi is the name of a kpop artist I really like (lol), but honestly it was super good and worth ordering again! I can see why it got a lot of high reviews - the pork belly kakuni inside had a delicious almost smoky flavor to it, and the bun was super soft. The daikon/carrot/mayo garnish really puts it over the top - so so good! For my main course, I ordered the black garlic tonkotsu ramen with chashu. I wasn't as impressed with this dish. I didn't taste the black garlic as much (perhaps if I had a regular tonkotsu to compare it with I would?) and the broth felt lighter than what I normally prefer. I will give them credit for the egg - that was a fantastic soft-boiled egg! My friend ordered the Katsu Curry and enjoyed it a lot. I can't comment on it since I didn't try it myself, but she's picky so I'll trust her positive reviews as they come! The restaurant is located right across the street from the Japantown Center, so you can go there for easy (paid) parking. The staff were also very kind to us and gave me a heads up that the ramen would take a bit longer to prepare than the other dishes. They also use a POS system that allows you to pay right at your table, so your credit card never leaves your sight. I'd be willing to come back and try some other things on their menu (and order the Hoshi bun again!) since they have a wide variety of things to try."

        "Chris D.": "Was craving ramen during the rainy day and stopped by here for some ramen. Service was average, with our server coming back to refill our water several times during our visit. Ambiance is like a ramen bar, tight and cozy. APPS Agedashi Tofu: Great on a warm day. Broth was rich and flavorful. 4/5 Bun: Forgot the exact name but the pork belly was very rich and fatty. Paired really well with the bun. I think some sauce would have helped the bun be a little less dry but overall pretty good. 4/5 MAINS Gyokotsu: Very average broth and noodles. Beef on the bone was super flavorful tho. Very tender, well cooked and packed with flavor. Just wished the flavor went to the broth as well. 3/5 overall but beef on bone was 4.5/5 Black Garlic: Rich, more flavorful that the Gyokotsu. Not super garlicky tho. Noodles were average, kinda reminded me of noodles from an instant ramen pack. Chashu was nicely seared but not much flavor to it. 3.5/5 Overall, don't see myself coming back."

We decided on one rolled bites plate and two appetizers. We wanted to eat yet not so much that we would have leftovers. Our server was so helpful and friendly, possibly one of the owners. He helped us decide on what to order as we were indecisive and also wanted to try something new. For apps, we had the ful (Fava bean mashed up with lemon and garlic oil-YUMMMM) and the jibneh haloummi (salted fried cheese. Yes, salted fried cheese!) and musakhan (chicken and onions wrapped up in pita bread) for sharing. Those were perfect recommended by our server. He knew we didn't want to fill up but wanted to try various options. Everything was just so delicious, my husband and I kept patting ourselves on the back on what a fantastic decision it was to dine here.

Small but comfortable covered and heated front outdoor seating, good indoor seating and also a back patio gives you plenty of options. The cuisine is Palestinian so you may find some of your favorite dishes are prepared a little different from what you may normally expect. Our host was welcoming and friendly as were the others tending to us on this night. The lentil soup was creamy and flavorful, as were the beef/lamb kafta and the shawarma. Note: Parking in the Mission on a Saturday night can be a nightmare. And because Freekeh is right in the main area, you will find yourself driving around forever.

        "Mike V.": "Hands down my new favorite Arabic/eastern Mediterranean restaurant in the City. And giving me yet another reason to come to this wonderful stretch of 16th Street. The service is impeccable. They will happily delve into what makes each dish unique and what countries and regions call it their own. They also serve just just arak over ice, although the side car and the smoke on the water were both excellent as well. For appetizers, I like their muhammara (red pepper walnut dip) better than Beit Rima (more on that later) but the house sampler is a safe way to start. The hot tapas are where they really shine. Jibneh Nabulsi (grilled Palestinian cheese)... to die for. I could eat a bowl of these in a heartbeat. Bamia bil Bandorah (okra, fried garlic, tomato)... perfect with or without the simmered lamb. Recommend holding off on the lamb if that's your thing and ALSO ordering the Mansaf (spiced lamb with saffron rice, yogurt sauce and toasted almonds). Definitely our favorite dish if we had to choose one. As for dessert, the kanafeh is a must (crispy baked shredded phyllo stuffed with cheese, drizzled with a house syrup and pistachios) and you might as well get the qatayef (baked crepe with walnuts and cinnamon and syrup) because they fresh bake both (they say 20 minutes but it was less than half that time). And yes, we had a lengthy and lively debate trying to rank Freekeh and Beit Rima after we rolled our very stuffed and satisfied selves towards the Chapel. For me, unless I'm feeling like the Branzino (which BR does exceptionally well), I am choosing Freekeh, especially for larger groups (the back patio is fabulous) and for date nights (better ambiance). BR is definitely more \"lively\" but also feels very rushed. And with food this good, and service this pleasant, I prefer to sit and savor."

This was cooked and seasoned to perfection. * Scallops: I loved the combination of flavors for this dish. Everything just works! * Patatas bravas: Simple but delicious! * Croquetas: Another favorite of mine. The truffle adds a nice richness. We also ordered drinks.

Detailed review for the rest of you ;-) Came here to celebrate 2 birthdays. Spanish food sounded good, and different. As others say, finding parking is a real bear! The restaurant has a charming atmosphere, located right on a busy and visible corner - good people-watching. The restaurant is larger than you might think - it goes back into a couple of back rooms. Bathroom is back there too (be careful of the step into the back!). Nice and heated! We had some Lar de Sotomayor Tempranillo to start, along with 3 shared plates: Albondigas (great flavor, nice sauce), Bacalhau (soup, nice taste), and Seared Scallops (really good). For mains, we had the Pork Loin (good flavor, well prepared), NY Strip Steak (tasty, done accurately to medium rare), and the Seafood Paella (good, but maybe as others have said, could use a little more flavoring). For dessert, we had the Flan, the Dulce de Leche ice cream, and the Bunuelos. All were very tasty. All in all, a nice fancy dinner. The food was tasty, the dishes presented very well, but the prices were pretty high ($42 for paella). Not a place we could go to very often, but great for a special occasion like this."

The portions are super generous, though; it can feed two, or you can pack it up and have a whole other meal for lunch! The seafood was fresh. I wish there was a little extra oomph to it.

It was really hard finding parking but we were lucky to find one close to the restaurant after looking for about 10 minutes. There were only two people in the restaurant at the time we got there (around 5:30pm) and we were seated. I liked the ambiance, it was quiet and a little dark...perfect for a date. There was a couple sitting at the bar and the owner (at least he looked like the owner) was speaking to them. It seemed like everyone that came in knew the owner and he even hugged one of the ladies that came. I thought it was odd that he never said a word to us although he looked at our table a few times.  We ordered the following:  Croquets: I liked the crispiness of these but I thought they were quite bland. Chicken-Potato soup: This soup was actually REALLY good. I loved the flavors, the chicken (not too many pieces) and the crispy toast on top. Would love a bowl right now. Paella: I was in Spain in June and in comparison to the Paellas I had there, I wasn't satisfied with this one. Seafood was cooked well, the clams had a splash of wine that I didn't care for. Overall I mostly likely won't be going back. It was a far drive for us and then we didn't get the best customer service. Parking was tough and I know my husband didn't enjoy any of his food.

Croquetas - who doesn't love fried food? Persimmons - served with burrata and some salad mix - delicious! I've never tried this combo and it was delicious Roasted Carrots - solid as well, nothing too surprising about it but loved it as a veggie side Steak Tartare - delicious! Served with these big rice chips that were a perfect complement to the creamy tartare Ashamed to say that I don't quite remember our last dish...but I think it was the Patatas Bravas.

They have a small-ish lunch time menu with appetizers/entrees and a separate drinks menu. I got the no-shrimp Papaya Salad which turned out okay. The portion size was decent, but I wish they'd rein in the qty of lemon zest/vinaigrette which ended up overpowering the dish and made the salad pretty soggy."

Lunch menu is small, but everything was so delicious, fresh and flavorful. Papaya salad and bokchoy are good starters. Khao soi has a refreshing broth and lime-y kick. The yawaraj noodles were my favorite ~ love the texture of the noodles with loads of cilantro and XO sauce."

Their mushroom truffle appetizer, stir fry beans and the chicken wings were exceptional. From the mains, the cod dumplings and noodles were great. The shrimp was a bit small for an appetizer portion. The drinks in particular were good - try the Tom yum cocktail for sure. They also have non alcoholic options and an extensive wine list. We tried the black rice pudding for dessert. They also have a food pannacota. For parking there are garages within a 1-2 block radius."

It has a very chill and relaxed vibe to it, but the food is fantastic. We got: Mushroom hor mok $14 Pretty hot wings $12 Kua Kling ribs (very very spicy so watch out) $16 Khun yai's rabbit green curry $36 My Thai $14 Service was fast and the food was amazing. I loved the green curry and mushroom hor mok. The ribs were a bit too spicy for me, but it's the way to go if you're looking for something extreme in the spice section! This is my 4th Michelin star restaurant and honestly they just don't let me down. I'm very impressed"

        "Claudia S.": "Based on the food, I'm not sure if I will ever be back. Servers were nice and attentive, but you can also tell that they meet a lot of people who are overly enthusiastic about their food so they start to act like all that. No points docked, just observations. The restaurant also smelled like wet dog upon entry (I saw a recent Google review noting a smell too, so I'm definitely not tripping), not great to be put off as soon as you arrive... Anywho, onto the food. We had the Hor Mok (mushroom curry mousse with crispy rice crackers) that everyone orders - not a lot of flavor, wasn't impressed at all. Prawn ceviche, the spotted prawns are off season so not sweet at all and honestly barely meets the definition of fresh, which is vital in a ceviche dish. The large amount of herbs on top provided no addition to the flavors and were just extremely distracting. Plah pla muek (squid in spicy/tangy sauce). Very spicy, although that is not an issue, it really took away the depth that this dish could've had. I see garlic, I see fish sauce and citrus, but there was no layer when it's just spicy - a bit more sugar in the marinade can help in this combination. Nonetheless, this was a far more memorable dish than the appetizers. The Massaman beef curry was the best dish of the night, but tbh, I can get that elsewhere and it shouldn't be the Hail Mary at a one-star spot. Lastly, the famous Kin Khao coffee panna cotta. Just not good. Again, issues with the intended layers - 0 coffee flavor came through, 0 sea salt came through, one bite and it's all toasted coconut.  Thai food is one of my favorite cuisines, both the authentic, seafood-forward, and region-based dishes from Thailand and the Americanized Thai food. Whatever Kin Khao is offering here, while they have been categorized as \"bold, unapologetic flavors\", I'm not sure it is all that likable."

My friend and I ordered the yum som-o, caramelized pork belly, and the yawaraj noodle. Service was great as the dishes came out pretty quickly, and timed well! Felt like one came right after we finished the other. The winter citrus salad was very light and bright as the white soy vinaigrette was really the star. Caramelized pork belly was soooo good. Really fatty and tender cubes packed with sweet and savory flavors. So good with rice. My favorite was the noodle dish! Texture of the noodles were perfectly soft.  Personally for the portions, I thought the meal was a bit pricy, but it was still delicious. Only thing I didn't love was the thai tea I ordered -- wish it was a bit sweeter! Would come back to try the wings which I hear are good!"

Made a reservation few weeks ahead for a party of 4.  Visited on Friday evening and it was quite busy after 6pm with a wait outside.  We got 4 different cocktails, and most of them were less sweet and strong.  My Thai $16 Tropical Mai Tai with a hint of Thai.  Cha Yen $16 I got this boozy Thai Tea. Siam Sipper $16 Thai-styled Old Fashioned. Pumara $16 Tequila mixed with Agave. We ordered 2 appetizers, 1 starter and 1 main course to share among the four of us. It was a decent amount of food and most of them were spicy.  Khao Kan Jin $23 This is highly recommended by the waiter, which is a pork rice blood sausage mixed with garlic chips, shallots, cilantro and lime.  Plah Pla Muek $25 My favorite of the night was the charred Monterey Bay Squid in a spicy sauce.  Kua Kling Ribs $28 The Hellfire ribs in Southern-Style Turmeric Curry paste, which were quite spicy.  Massaman Nuea $48 Braised beef cheeks in Massaman Curry. It has a strong flavor with potatoes and shallots in the curry sauce.  Coffee Panna Cotta $15 For dessert we got the panna cotta with coffee syrup, taro and espresso sea salt.  In general, the food and atmosphere were good but not great, but the price point was high since it is a Michelin one star restaurant, so I don't think this place worth the hype."

I ordered the CVT deluxe burger and the cheese skirt (a nod to Squeeze-In no doubt) did not disappoint. After taking a bite of the skirt I folded the edges inside the burger for max flavor. The bun on this burger is so soft and warm which is rare for gf buns. The fries are fried in the same fryer as other gluten items so I got the salad and it was really good. Lots of fresh flavors and crisp textures, and the acid cut the richness of the burger perfectly.  For cocktails I ordered the Dancing Bear and Lady Made #6. Both were refreshing and delicious.

We are very disappointed about the experience, and feel hurt by it, because we live in the neighborhood, and this could have been our go-to place.  I was excited to take my friend for brunch with my 9 month old baby. The owner gave us a high chair with broken safety belt. He said I could just put the baby in without the harness seat belt, which would be absolutely unsafe since the baby can fall. I pointed it out him to ask for another chair for my child's safety. He cut me off before I finished and insisted that was all he had.  However, I've been to this restaurant before with a safe high chair when it was a server that served us. I shared that with him, and he brought the other high chair with a better safety belt. It was still half broken but at least can be buckled. I explained to him the safety belt that can be buckled is what I was looking for for baby's safety. He then got mad and yelled to me, \"ok, you are right, I'm wrong. Is this what you want???\" Living in San Francisco for years, we have been to many restaurants. I have never encountered this kind of attitude, especially coming from the owner of the restaurant.  It's important to make sure young children (sitting with a seat belt) and women/mothers (not being yelled at when you simply want to make sure your child's safety) feel safe.  I hope the owner of the restaurant take this opportunity to improve his knowledge about high chair safety and his attitude towards female customers."

The place is cute and is usually pretty packed in the evenings so we decided to stop by in the afternoon for a drink. We were \"greeted\" by the most bored looking, non-caring waitress I have ever had in my life! We were immediately told they weren't serving food and only had small snacks which was fine because we only wanted drinks. BUT I want to just mention, its not so much what she said, it was HOW she said it, it was almost like she was done looking at customers and wanted us to leave and give her a break! UGH :( Anyway....the drinks were GREAT! The bartenders really whip up some tasty drinks with a kick :)  The waitress came by and checked in on us, but it really seemed like she didn't care if we were doing ok or not or wanted to run out of the place. Total energy vampire and it made us want to leave! SO WE DID....We finished our drinks and I looked around for the waitress but I guess she was on break talking it up at the bar and looked like she had gotten some life back in her?!?!.  Anyway, a nice dude that worked there came by and asked if we needed anything else, chatted for a moment and gave us our bill. I have to say I wish we had HIM THE WHOLE TIME! He was really cool and genuine and I wish I got his name because he made the visit a 5 star rather than a 3 star because of that energy vampire, so I decided to settle in the middle at 4 stars.

The waitress was lovely but it did take a good while for my food to come out. We ordered the shrimp stuffed eggplant, the sticky rice with shrimp, and the cumin lamb. Hubby really enjoyed the eggplant. His sticky rice was described to me as \" interesting.\" The cumin lamb was very good. It came with lots of crunchy onions and peppers. This dish was supposed to be spicy since it had three stars. I'd describe it as medium. It benefited from soy sauce which was readily available at the table.  They do have their dinner menu available all day long which was good since i did not want anything on the dim sum menu. Overall this place was very good.

I would say that the dishes I got were solid, but not good enough to compensate for just how expensive they were. We ordered 7 dishes and two cups of tea (yeah no teapots to share here), and our total after tip was $106! Honestly, kind of atrocious. One order of rice roll was almost $12 and an order of buns (3) was $8. If you don't want to do the math, I'll do it for you: that's $2.60 PER BUN, for a bun that's 1/3 the size of your palm. Bruh. The buns were fluffy and had tasty fillings. The rice rolls were pretty good (bamboo shoots were a nice touch). The egg yolk paste in the lava egg yolk buns was really good. Cold noodles surprisingly not a lot of flavor. Spicy and mala, but lacking in any savoriness. Also noodles were a doughy and just kind of dense, not QQ at all. And it cost almost $16. I think if the price of every dish was cut in half, I would consider coming back. Otherwise, there are just so many other cheaper, better options in SF to be going to."

We grabbed some pork and veggie dumplings, eggplant and chicken, an order of kung pao chicken, and the hot and numbing fish. I grabbed a Dupont Saison, which pairs with spicy Chinese food amazingly! I've never done the Szechuan flavor before, and while it's a little overwelming on its, own, it was still really fun with other spicy dishes. The flavors are full and perfectly seasoned.  It's a little out of the way from the main restaurants in the Castro, but absolutely worth the extra trek!"

The wait on a Sunday afternoon confirmed it :)  Ambiance - classic fast casual restaurant, tile flooring and tables with regular dining chairs.  Service - like dim sum restaurants, you circle what you want and they bring it to you. A little hard to flag down the waiters to order something off the regular menu not on the dim sum menu, but very helpful and fast once ordered.  Food: We got the steamed vegetarian buns, veggie noodles with chili bean paste, the clay pot vegetables, and the Triple C tofu (we never did find out what each C meant ....) Noodles: well cooked noodles, very heavy (too heavy?) on sauce, rich in flavor, but wish it had more veggies/spice coming through.  Hot Pot: similar profiles as the sauce on the noodles, veggies/tofu cooked nicely and the mushrooms added a nice texture too Triple C Tofu: HIGHLY recommend - tofu was super nicely cooked, the outside was sweet/saucy/crispy, and the portion was a great size.  Overall, everything we ordered was saucy / sweeter / heavier that it all blended a bit in my head, but still yummy - steamed veggie buns were a nice palette cleanser! Def recommend finding other dishes on the menu if you're veggie / vegan than just the dim sum. On the pricier side as well!"

Pro: - buying a bottle of wine is cheap compared to most places. - Lots of chicken compared to most Chongqing chicken orders - milder usage of spices (good if you prefer those) Cons - The chongqing chicken wasn't typical to what you see of a Chongqing chicken order.

I ordered from DoorDash and have to say that some photos were HUGELY inconsistent with the food. Still a lot of it was great. I'll go dish-by-dish: The best: --Hot and numbing fish: perfectly crispy fried fish with a spicy outer layer. Everyone's favorite --Cumin lamb: tender lamb with onions and green peppers, the meat was just really tasty --Shrimp stuffed eggplant: soft fried eggplant with shrimp filling --Crispy Eggplant: deep-fried eggplant. Not very distinctive (not much seasoning) but still a great add. These were all good/ok, not great but hard to mess up: --Dry fried green beans: this was not like other dry fried green beans, they were more soggy --Stir-fried pea leaves with garlic --Mother chen's bean curd (their version of mapo tofu) Bad:  These looked NOTHING like the photos, which was pretty disappointing.  --Beijing Style Chicken and Eggplant: The photo shows a more traditional garlic eggplant dish, this was extremely dry --Chongqing Chicken: this was red, in contrast with the photo and other dry-fried chicken I'd had. Very misleading and not good --Boiled Beef Slices in a Fiery Sauce: again, nothing like the photo. Very little spice and tasted more like a Chunkys beef strew... As a price reference, every dish was $20 except for crispy eggplant ($16) and the smaller shrimp-stuffed eggplant ($10, just ~4 pieces) Note: I couldn't add my full caption to the photo, here it is: Clockwise from top: Dry fried green beans, Beijing Style Chicken and Eggplant, Crispy Eggplant, Shrimp stuffed eggplant, Mother chen's bean curd, Chongqing Chicken, Boiled Beef Slices in a Fiery Sauce, Stir-fried pea leaves with garlic, Hot and numbing fish"

My girlfriend was running a little late since she was coming from Equinox. As I was waiting for her, the host attempted to seat some guy in her seat. I told him that my girlfriend was almost here and he said that this man could move over when she got here. He reminded me that I had to leave by 7:30pm--I was well-aware. He refused to allow me to save her seat. As she arrived at 6:50pm, I waved to her. In the same moment this was occurring, this same host then sat two people right next to the stranger he sat next to me, leaving no seats at the bar for her to sit at. It felt purposeful and created such an awkward situation: the stranger he had sat next to me apologizing profusely as my girlfriend stood there awkwardly with no seat. Myself, being forced to leave a full glass of Barolo so we could find accommodations elsewhere. Incredibly rude, awkward and the worst service I have ever experienced here.

There's so many incredible eateries in Embarcadero and Kokkari Estiatorio is definitely one of the best. Upscale while cozy atmosphere (esp if you're near the fireplace). If you're stuck on recommendations, the staff are more than knowledgeable enough to share their personal favorites + wine pairings. Our group of 4 shared: - MELITZANOSALATA (excellent sampler of fresh spreads, must try the roe dip!) - HALLOUMI STO FOURNO (MY fav-- savory, crispy, AND tart with fresh pomegranate) - OCTAPODAKI TOU YIORGOU (very smoky, super tender) - PSARI PSITO (rotates, this was some type of sweet whitefish) - KOTOPOULO SOUVLAS (flavorful, succulent-- a whole meal in itself) Other than your basic gyros, souvlaki, general ambiguously Mediterranean-inspired dishes, I've had no other exposure to Greek food-- Kokkari was a lovely introduction to their finer fare.

Also a delicious selection of greek wine... recommend getting a bottle of santorini wine to share with the table! As for the food itself: -Zucchini Cakes (5/5): these are some of my favorite greek apps and these were so good! The dip it came with was thick yet light and the zucchini cakes themselves were stuffed with zucchini, not oily or over fried at all, and you were definitely able to see and taste the thin shreds of zucchini -Spanakotiropita (3/5): very flaky and flavorful, but a little much on the cheese side (overpowering the other great ingredients inside) -Octopus (4/5): succulent, charred, flavorful. a little too generous with the olive oil though. On par with other delicious octopus I have had before -Dip platter (2.5/5): honestly a bit disappointing. the pita was not warm and the only dip I really enjoyed, although it was slightly thicker and heavier than usual, was the tzatziki. -Sea Bass (3.5/5): I thought the fish was really good. the skin was so thin and crisp and honestly stole the show. The fish could have been slightly more tender though and it did get a little old... maybe a couple more sides other than just boiled greens could have been nice to complement the flavors of the fish -Yiaourti Granita (5/5): wow SO GOOD. did not expect this dessert to be so light, tart, and flavorful. the yogurt sorbet was thicker than I expected (more of an ice cream consistency) but it was so light and tart in flavor. It paired so well with the refreshing fruit sorbet. The dessert also came with a delicious, slightly sweet candied nut shell that was so thin, light and flavorful and honestly was so fun to break it apart and eat it by itself or with the sorbet!!

I wish we had been specific regarding table choice when we made our reservation. There were lovely table close to the fireplace and also by the windows. We got stuck at the table closest to the door. Everytime someone came in it left I would get a cold breeze. We ordered the octopus appetizer, the roast chicken, and the zucchini cakes. Everything was very good. I did feel that the roast chicken needed salt. I also have had better chicken at Limon for less."

        "Jess M.": "Came here on a Friday at around 2pm for lunch, and the hostess Carlye was super kind and accommodating. This restaurant is huge, and the chairs and decor is very comfortable. We ordered several appetisers - caviar dip with pita, zucchini cakes, saghanaki, and the lamb riblets. All were super delicious, flavourful and brought out very quickly. For entree we got one lamb chop each, and shared a whole fish. Cindy gave us really good recommendations, and it was definitely enough food for two people. We finished off with the blood orange pastry and the strawberry granita, both of which were not too heavy and really delicious, a great way to end off a meal."

        "Lauren S.": "The stuffed grape leaves were excellent, as was the homemade pita. The lamb shank (kokinisto) was melting at the touch of a fork and the serving was huge. As tender and well cooked as it was, I do think it could have had a bit more flavor. It seemed a little basic. The service is phenomenal, the prices higher than I would pay in nyc for something equivalent. Overall, still would rate it a 4/5."

        "Mary V.": "Kokkari is a San Francisco institution, and one of my all-time favorite restaurants! Kokkari (and sister restaurant Evvia in Palo Alto) is known for their elevated Greek cuisine and warm hospitality. Their consistency in both areas is the reason they've stayed open since the 1980s! I've been to Kokkari for work and special occassions a handful of times over the years and was fortunate to return in the fall for a work lunch. We toured the menu and loved it all: -Saghanaki - fried cheese - DO IT! -Dip sampler with homemade pita -Summer peach salad -Moussaka -Lamb -Salmon -Sole special -Ravioli -Cookie platter Add some Greek white wine, recommended by our server. And the rustic ambiance. Take me to Greece!  Menu items I love from past visits: -Gigantes -Zucchini cakes -Greek salad -Kokkari salad Our server Todd was welcoming, knowledgeable, and attentive. The restaurant was busy, as it always seems to be, with a wonderful energy. Make a reservation for your next special occasion and experience Kokkari for yourself!"

Arancini was crispy, gooey, and packed with flavor at only $7. I'm moving to this neighborhood! Did you hear me?  Yes, at these prices, I paid the toll and crossed the bridge. The food came out quickly but not rushed. Service was sweet and speedy. Who said Friday can be the only pizza night? I just broke the rules. The rooftop is a nice touch but it's also cozy and tres romantic in the main dining area. There's also a not so secret bar next door but you didn't hear that from me ;)"

I was excited last Sunday to have a brunch at this location not only bcoz of the sunny but a bit chilly weather, also i was with my close friends. The above patio was lovely somehow. When waiting for almost 30 mins for our late orders , ( which were just simple ) it finally cane as a mess. The salad was quite good. Then the vegan omelet salty and dry. The thin crust pizza was burned on top but i I just cant explain the chewiness of it ??? The fresh squeeze orange was okay but was too ice packed.Cinnamon roll was too sugary sweet. I had request for a much hot brewed coffee for my friend . It cane just warm not hot. Then our server forgot one of the orders too , that we just had enough if it and had it cancelled. What can i say more for almost $110 brunch. ( 3 people )"

        "Karen Y.": "First time trying this place out after walking past it multiple times. Decided to come during Restaurant Week!  Made a reservation for Sunday brunch and were seated really quickly. Was upstairs at the covered patio and it's such a nice space with the heat lamps (zero chill/wind). Ordering was fairly quick--ordered the OG Baby Lettuce Salad, Croque Madame, and Nogroni. Nogroni -- best way I could describe it is an elevated orange soda. It's not bad but it's not the flavor profile I usually go for. I might try the other zero proof drinks on the menu next time.  OG Baby Lettuce Salad - it's a salad; light dressing with some texture and it's definitely a massaged salad so it was evenly dressed which I appreciate.  Croque Madame -- I'm used to Croque Madames usually on a harder bread like a sourdough so this was a first for me. Bread was warm and was the perfect vehicle to soak up all the sauce on the plate. Egg was nicely cooked and overall I just enjoyed how savory it was.  Bill was...to be expected. Restaurant week was $25 for one app + entree. After fees and tip (~18%) my overall was $50. A little high for brunch IMO but it was great to try this place out!"

        "George R.": "Flavors and textures excellent. Prices on par with everything else in the area - portions made us feel mostly satisfied. The cauliflower arancini was a cheesy, crunchy ball of delicious. The meatballs were soft, tender, seasoned nicely. So soft. Kale crudite didn't look appetizing but was surprisingly tasty. The kale was cooked down to a pleasant texture, and it worked well with the sharpness of the cheese. The potato, kale, pizza with pickled onions was a tasty interplay of flavors and texture - the accent added by the picked onions took it to the next level. The lamb pasta was my first time trying mafaldine pasta - long, wavy ribbons that look like they were trimmed from lasagna noodles edges. Expertly cooked to al dente. Full of meaty flavor. Thought that the Aperol spritz had a bit too much ice. The wine portions felt generous, I'll probably stick to wine next time."

        "Jennifer L.": "I've been to the Clement location a while ago but this was my first time checking out the Sunset location despite passing by all the time. We came here for an early 5 pm dinner (no reservations) after leaving Cal Academy. They had a few table choices inside but we opted to sit out front right underneath one of their heaters even though it was rainy and cold that day. The wind was blocked, it was completely covered so rain wasn't an issue, and tbh it was warmer than it was inside. * OG BABY LETTUCE SALAD Lovely presentation with the various colors of fresh produce and edible flowers. The salad had a mix of textures that jazzed it up. It came with a creamy avocado dressing which we got on the side and I would not recommend doing that because it's so thick that it was difficult to mix ourselves. * FUNGHI PIE This was one of the recommendations from our server. It was a savory pie with umami flavor coming from the mushroom medley. The crust was chewy and thin enough to fold yet sturdy enough that it wasn't flimsy. While good, I think I would've liked a bit more cheese and garlic, and I felt like something was missing from the pizza although I can't pinpoint what. * ALMOND MEYER LEMON RICOTTA CAKE Initially we were a little bummed when they brought this out because the edges were charred but thankfully after eating that part it didn't taste burnt at all. The cake was so light which was perfect after eating carbs. I mostly got almond notes with a hint of lemon. The homemade strawberry jam was amazing. There were chunks of strawberry and it wasn't too sweet. You could see the specs of vanilla bean inside the gelato that was scooped on top. The toasted pine nuts broke up the overall soft textures of the dessert and added a nutty flavor. We enjoyed this. Service was good - the hostess was bubbly and our server checked on us throughout the meal and kept our pitcher of water refilled. The only thing is that he did make us feel rushed several times throughout the meal even though there was no time limit on our table. Like he asked us if we needed boxes when we were halfway into our meal and left us the dessert menu while there was still food on our plates. Overall this was a positive dining experience and I could see us returning in the future. Grazie, Fiorella!"

        "Ry T.": "Food here is pretty good. It was our 2nd time dining here after the theater. We arrived a bit before 5 PM and had to wait outside while the staff set up.  Our shared appetizer was a pepperoni pizza. The dough looks big but it's airy and light. I do not like doughy, thick bread pizzas. I would come here just for pizza and a salad.  I had the winter citrus salad. Not enough greens for me but lots of orange. Hubby and BFFs had the rigatoni bolognese. I tried a bite and thought it had really good flavor. But hubby told me after dinner that it was too salty. The portions are not large so if you're a big eater, you will need to order more food. The mushroom risotto was OK but hard to judge because I only had a big bite of it. Plenty of mushroom was mixed into it.  We ended with sharing 2 chocolate budino. It's like a very thick pudding with a nice chocolate flavor, made with local chocolate.  Staff was friendly and I liked the brand of ginger beer $4. Felt a bit rushed because they bus the empty plates off the table pretty quickly.  I would come back and like to try sone of the other dishes. By 5:45 pm on a week night, all the tables filled up. Reservations recommended."

        "Sarah L.": "Summery: Get the funghi pie!!  I love the roof deck setting with the plants and really appreciate the heater as well. The staff was very attentive and service was fast.  CHITARRA ALLA CARBONARA (3.5/5) Very el dente pasta with a thick cheesy carbonara sauce. The sauce is a bit dry in my opinion but it's flavorful and well seasoned. I wish there would be more guanciale. FUNGHI PIE (5/5) I am a big fan of mushroom pizza and I always get it if there's one on the menu. This pizza is probably the most delicious mushroom pizza I've ever had! There was a generous amount of mushrooms and they were cooked perfectly (not too soft). The flavors were well balanced and the toppings were evenly spread out over the pie dough. I recommend adding anchovies to the pie or have it on the side. The anchovies add an umami flavor which compliment the mushrooms really well.  SALSICCIA PIE (4/5) The house-made sausage was delicious and well seasoned (not too salty). The flavor of the sausage went well with the calabrian chili salsa verde and there was a generous amount of whipped ricotta. I personally enjoyed the funghi pie over this one, but this was still delicious."

Amazing interior and I absolutely love the indoor outdoor second floor patio. Great food (on the pricey end of Italian) but really good. The pasta was a great flavor, good portion. Fungi pie was also really good, my suggestion for them would be to add truffle and it would be divine. The cauliflower Arancis were unique and delicious I'd recommend. Best part of it all was the chocolate budino. Oh my god, a chocolate lovers heaven. I usually don't get dessert out cause I'm too full but I did this time and I'm so happy I did. Service was really friendly as well!! Highly recommend!"

First time had the calamari appetizer (traditional but done very well) and the miso salmon, which was excellent. Comes with fried tofu cubes - first time anyone has made me like tofu. Perfect crispy skin on the salmon. Second dinner had the fried oysters (again typical but done perfectly and great ponzu sauce), then the scallop mini burger app: sliced raw scallop stuffed with raw salmon and salmon skin, with a namasu like sauce. Oh my god so good. Then the salmon volcano, perfectly cooked rare and presented on the mound of rice, topped with the egg- break that and let it run over the whole thing, it was amazing. Mochi ice cream for dessert, best I've ever had. Tiny wine list but the Sonoma Cutrer chard goes perfect with the food. I live Hawaii and back home this would have been a $150 dinner easy, I was out for $75 here. Server was super efficient and friendly.

I feel like atmosphere is pretty casual, vibes seem a bit more suited for a lunch than dinner, but that being said, happy hour menu is great!  Off the hh menu, we ordered a dozen oysters ($18), which came with tobiko and green onion- basically a japanese-style oyster shooter on the shell- so so so good. We also got chicken yakitori (2 pieces for 4.50). My boyfriend really liked this one. We also got kabli- korean marinated short rib ($9.50), and this was super flavorful. Really enjoyed this one, but will say it was quite fatty. My bf also got a large Asahi ($5.50).  Off the normal menu, we got salmon nigiri ($6 for 2 pieces)- which was good. We also got the udon soup with sukiyaki beef ($14)- this has onion in it that made it kind of like a french onion flavor, which wasn't my favorite, my bf liked it. The sukiyaki was also super fatty and didn't feel like it was super flavorful- but a good portion size. I liked that it had an egg, but it was slightly over cooked. We also got the sayuri nigori (300 mL for $14) and it was really good- not too sweet, yet still a creamier profile.  Overall, really enjoyed myself and happy hour is such a great deal. The atmosphere was just ok, but hopefully gets better as more people find out about this spot. Would come again!"

The scallop was sweet and soft. We also got the scallop burgers. The flavor was very light, but that allowed you to really taste the salmon and the scallops. Will HAVE to return for happy hour now."

The salmon don is delicious. The salmon was lightly seared and melts in your mouth. The gooey egg on top just melds together with the rice and seasoning and sauce. There's so much salmon on the menu as the restaurant name suggests but there's also other options such as skewers if you want some meat options. We also got the curry croquettes and clam chowder croquettes. The clam chowder croquette was unique and was the better of the two in my opinion. Oysters were a great deal, I could have eaten a whole dozen myself if I didn't do a main entree. They were sweet and decent sized and looked fancy just from the simple sprinkling of roe and green onions.  Only con is parking in this area could be difficult to find."

I thought everything tasted delicious especially with the added house made orange sauce. You can add the extra sauce to anything and it'll make it that much more delicious.  The paella came with shrimp, clams, peas, scallops, and mussels. I thought it lacked flavor but with the orange spicy, creamy sauce it elevated the dish. Definitely great for 2 people. Anything more would have been too much. We even had some leftovers to go.  The calamari was standard. Wish it was a little bit more salty and crispy but all in all good. The potatoes were yummy.

Calamari 4/5 the calamari was good and I liked the sauce it came with. It could've been crispier. Paella 2/5. They gave a lot, but it was pretty bland. I don't think the paella is worth it. It was mushy and kinda tasteless. Sangria pitchers 5/5 the white sangria pitcher tastes so much better than the red. The red I would give a 3/5, but the white was fruity, sweet, and delicious.

I visited Picaro on Saturday for a date night with my husband just before 6 pm and I am so glad I made a reservation in advance because the place was packed.  This restaurant is good for a romantic date, as well as an outing with your family and friends. Our server was very knowledgeable and informative, she kept checking on us and even made some good recommendations.  Both of us got the red wine sangria and it was delicious. For the food we ordered the following- Croquetas de Pollo- These chicken croquettes were flavourful and I loved having every bite of them specially when that burst of cheese hits your mouth. One of my favourite dishes of the night. Chorizo Cantimpalitos- I have always been a fan of sausages and these sausages were absolutely delectable. This dish had the perfect balance of flavours.  Oysters- My husband had these and he told me these are some of the most fresh and delicious oysters he has had.  Patatas Aioli- I love the potatoes but I didn't like the Aioli sauce much. Will stick to the spicy sauce next time.  Free Bread with sauce- Omg they serve the best sauce with the bread. It's so addictive and mouthwatering.  Overall we had a great time here. When we were about to leave a few men started playing beautiful Spanish music which lit up the ambience even more.  Would highly recommend this hidden gem for a great Spanish meal. I will definitely going to come back to try their Paella and have more Sangria."

These were all pretty good, but the paella was a little too much on the salty side for me. We also had the sangria, which was a perfect addition to the meal!

The menu at Picaro is simply outstanding, featuring a wide range of tapas, paellas, and other classic Spanish dishes that are prepared with the finest ingredients. Whether you're in the mood for savory chorizo, tender octopus, or flavorful paella, you'll find something to love at Picaro. We started off with the bread and their homemade spicy sauce. This orange sauce is so delicious and I would out it on anything! We also ordered some sangria and fried calamari.  For the main dishes we had the grilled seafood and meal platters: - Mariscada: Seafood platter with calamari, shrimp, jumbo tiger shrimp, clams, mussels, snapper and salmon over a bed of Spanish rice.  - Parillada: Grilled meat platter with chorizo, morcilla, chicken, pork kebabs and carne asada, served on a bed of potatoes Highly recommend trying either of these. 1 platter is enough to share with 4 people and we had lots of leftovers to take home."

The bread and sauce for the table is always a treat as well. The sauce goes with everything! It wasn't too busy so got seated right away. We'd made a reservation thru Yelp in case it was busy tho.

        "Divya K.": "I personally thought this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong the food is good, but any entree on that menu is not worth $30+ which seems to be the minimum. The golden fried prawns were good, the spicy rigatoni wasn't too special. Garlic bread was on the dryer side and not that flavorful. The wisest way to dine here would be to split entrees since the portions are large.  Cocktails are decent, lots of options. We got the aperol spritz which had sort of a bitter after taste. Reservations can be made online and no complaints with the service."

I started off the night with a lemon drop martini - a cocktail on the sweeter on the side if you're into that. For the main course, I got the ala bruno steak which I thought was just okay! I wish it was slightly more tender - was def on the chewier side. I always get my steak medium rare. I would come back to try their pastas next time though! As for sides I got the mashed potatoes and you can taste the saltiness to it, but I thought it was delicious!"

        "Kelekolio M.": "My favorite restaurant in SF, I've been coming here since I was in high school and as a college student living outside of the city, I love coming back and visiting this particular Original Joes. I only make reservations when holidays come up as wait times can be 2 hours, but if I walk in and wait it can be 30 min to an hour wait depending on the day and time. To get straight into it, the servers and waiters/waitresses are always kind and friendly. The restaurant gives a cozy and warm ambience with a lot of pictures showing the history of the restaurant in its early days.  Moving on to the food, I almost always get the same thing every time which is the linguine pesto. It always comes out hot and fresh with a good amount of pesto sauce and cheese. The taste is authentic and super delicious every time. My girlfriend ordered the ravioli which also tasted really good and meaty on the inside, for any ravioli lovers I'd recommend this. Nothing impressive about the caesar salad but still tastes good. Lastly for the fried calamari, we always order this flavorful appetizer because it has the right amount of crispiness and crunch it's hard to not finish it all.  Ultimately, Original Joes is a great spot for friends and families to come dine in for lunch and dinner. I believe this one in North Beach is the best one especially because you can go out afterwards and grab authentic gelato, drinks, or go take a walk at the park across the street. I always recommend people to dine here because they won't regret it!"

This was my first time, too. They opened at 10 a.m. on Saturdays. I highly recommend making a reservation. We had a reservation but that didn't stop us from getting bullied by a group of women that wanted to be seated ahead of us even though we were in line outside for about 10 minutes behind a family that they assumed we were with. We saw them approach and only asked the family if they were in line and didn't bother acknowledging anyone else that had been there prior to their arrival. And they said Americans are rude! Once seated, we were served by Martin. We ordered the Original Joe's and the Short Rib Ragu. I love that you could order breakfast and lunch at 10ish in the morning. Breakfast has never been my favorite, so having pasta for breakfast was brilliant. Both dishes were of generous portions, perfectly cooked and delicious. Service was also amazing! By the time we left, the restaurant was at full capacity. I can see why this is a popular favorite among locals and tourists alike."

I thought they forgot the banchan before realizing the tiny empty container was supposed to be it.. literally one single kimchi piece. Two pieces of kale.

We were craving some soondubu since it was a rainy day, and this spot made us feel warm and filled.  We ordered the vegetable dumplings fried, spicy cakes, and soft tofu stew with seafood and beef. The dumplings were pretty standard, but I enjoyed how crispy they were. The spicy cakes were different than other places because the sauce was a little bit more watery and soupy but nonetheless was still packed with flavor. The tofu stew was also really delicious, probably the best I've had in San Francisco. I love that it also came out bubbling hot. Along with our food, the servers brought out an assortment of banchan.  The restaurant itself is very simple and casual. There's plenty of tables, and there's a walk-in list posted by the door to put your name on if it gets a little busy. The servers are really friendly and nice. Food also comes out pretty quick. There's plenty of street parking nearby, as well."

        "Della S.": "Their soondubu is so flavorful, I can't wait to have it again! By default you can get a veggie soft tofu stew for $14, then add kimchi, beef, seafood, etc. for $3 more. They have 5 spice levels for the soup and you can choose between white or purple rice. I wasn't super hungry so I decided to just go with the veggie soft tofu stew with no add-ons. The stew came with a generous portion of tofu and also included an egg! The servers brought out 5 different side dishes while we waited for our orders. For a soft tofu stew with only vegetables, I found the broth to be packed with umami. I could drink the broth all day! Combined with the various veggies, tofu, and chewy purple rice, the stew was a filling and satisfying meal. The servers were very friendly and helpful which made for an overall positive experience. I look forward to trying other items on their menu."

The only thing is that the side dishes can be improved... It's probably one of my least favorite Korean side dishes I've encountered. Most of them lack of flavor even the kimchi. And the portions are very little. The restaurant is spacious and clean. And the staff is friendly. There's a waiting list when it gets busy so make sure you put your name on the list when you arrive."

        "Johnny W.": "Summary: Inconsistently priced, but not bad for SF Korean Details: * Their banchan selection (for take out, at least) is pretty measly and sad * Seafood pancake feels pretty overpriced, costing 30% less than peers, but also about 75% smaller * Their other dishes feel a bit more correctly valued (taking SF upcharge into account), and are actually fairly tasty, from their BBQ meats, to their soups, to their rice bowls * Oakland still has better Korean, but this is probably one of the closest spots you'll find in SF Accessibility: Another grab and go dinner, so can't comment much on accessibility"

We ended up getting 4 kinds of fish on it (salmon, tuna, shiro maguro, and I forget the fourth... maybe hamachi). Pretty basic but thick slices - spicy tuna roll - classic roll - spicy hamachi roll - loved this one. Similar to spicy tuna but had chunks of hamachi inside - rainbow roll - 8.5/10 Highly recommend.

        "Scott S.": "We came in on a Monday night after looking at rave Yelp reviews. Order was 1. Miso Chicken ramen ($18) 2. Hamachi Sashimi ($25), Lamb Chops ( $16), baby scallops ($13).  Ramen - came with pork instead of chicken. Serves 2 people admirably as an appetizer or 1 as a main course. Not a large portion but average. Taste profile is Good but price toooo high for a medium portion -3 stars Hamachi - way too expensive for five little bitty pieces of sashimi. It was so small I double check with the waitress to make sure that there was not a mistake. This amount of fish should've cost no more than $15. Indeed I had bluefin tuna sashimi that was MUCH better tasting the previous evening for 14.95. Taste was a terrible disappointment as it liked any depth OR any real flavor. 1 star. LAMB Chops - small and overpriced. Noticing a pattern here? In addition, although the waitress told me, this was season with garlic salt, we found the flavor profile to be lacking and sold absent appropriately cooked, medium rare, the lamb taste felt fairly flat. Perhaps it was frozen and the frosting as the waitress told me it came from Australia.1 star.  Baby Scallops - u get 2!!! Two little bitty, baby ( farmed not wild) scallops, and no I'm not kidding for $13. Tasty with their sauce, but hardly even an appetizer given the portion size. For this price, I expect wild, caught scallops, and at least four. .5 stars.  Atmosphere- is OK at trendy Japanese want to be in Noe Valley. Music is instrumental so you can carry on a conversation, but perhaps include occasional Japanese music to better set the atmosphere. 3 stars.  Service- waitress did not inquire about the satisfaction of the cuisine. Nor did she ask if we'd like anything else to eat, but summarily presented the bill. Value - miserable failure given the way over priced cuisine with just average quality ingredients. I can get farmed seafood anywhere, and a much better price, portion size and value. We cannot understand what the hype is about on yelp, and will not be back as there is much better food in a much better. Price point is much better service, many places in the city."

My husband got the fried chicken, and a few days later he's still talking about how he wants more chicken nuggets. Next time he'll have to try the katsu.

For drinks, I'd highly recommend trying the sparkling sake with jelly. One of the most unique drinks I've had, and both the yuzu and peach flavors were super tasty. Food-wise, our group of 3 ordered 7 dishes (ootoro, hamachi crudo, mentaiko udon, fried oysters, top secret, agedashi tofu, and eryngi mushrooms) and thought it was a satiating amount of food. I'm still dreaming about the perfect garlic butter sauce in the mushrooms, but once again, everything was delicious and you can't go wrong!

        "David K.": "Taksim is an chef-driven, modern, elegant restaurant fusing Turkish cuisine with Californian ingredients. To start, we had the Taksim dips sampler, a colorful plate of tzatziki, muhammara, hummus, baba ghanoush, eggplant conserva, and tomato marmalade, along with rounds of soft, chewy whole wheat pita bread. We ordered extra pita on the side, and got the ones flavored with cheese, roasted garlic, and za'atar; as well as a basket of Bazlama, three crusty, honey-sweetened bread rolls served with sumac butter on the side.  One of Taksim's signature starters was the King Shrimps, two gigantic shrimps poached in butter and wrapped in crunchy kadaif (shredded phyllo) and served with muhammara on the side. The Za'atar Roasted Carrot Salad was topped with seasonal spring pea tendrils along with walnuts, pepitas, sesame, citrus, sultanas, and avocado, all on a bed of whipped kefir, and the composition had a nice combination of tangy and earthy flavors. But the most beautifully-plated starter of all was the Lamb Carpaccio, made of thinly-sliced olive-crusted lamb topped with urfa pepper aioli, lemon oil, arugula, and crispy shallots, and the colorful plate looked like a work of art! And finally came our entrees. The Harissa Short Ribs were two incredibly tender, fatty, bone-in beef ribs served with a spicy chili sauce, a smokey eggplant labneh, fried shishito peppers, and orzo rice, and the flavors were savory, spicy, unctuous, smokey, and tangy all at the same time. But my favorite dish of all was the Branzino, two fillets with perfectly crispy skin served with grilled sea beans, glazed turnips, and an anchovy rice pilaf with pine nuts and raisins. The fish itself was intentionally left unsalted, as the crunchy sea bean vegetable (which I've only ever had while traveling in Turkey) and anchovies had a naturally salty flavor, so the combination of ingredients resulted in a perfectly balanced dish. Overall, the execution, flavors, and plating of the food were all on point, and the service was super friendly and attentive too!"

        "Laura D.": "Came here unintentionally because my husband messed up another reservation nearby. It all worked out though! Really impressed with Taksim.  Food: we got started off with a complementary palate cleanser of a soup from a root vegetable from turkey (amazing way to kick off because it was so delicious). we shared a few apps and all were delicious: 3 dips, king shrimp, and the lamb carpaccio (this one was the star! So so delicious). We were getting full so decided to stop there but the other apps looked delicious as well. For dessert we opted for the donuts and to my surprise, I ate the entire thing. I don't have a big sweet tooth but the way they made this dessert was brilliant. The donuts themselves are not sweet and you get to pick the sweet bite to go with it (chocolate sauce, ice cream, mascarpone) every bit is different and the texture of the donuts was heaven.  Drinks: i had the sivas legal which was yummy and husband enjoyed his Syrah. Ended the meal with a yummy Turkish coffee.  Service: so good! Seco (apologies I'm sure I'm misspelling) was so attentive and the pace of the meal was perfect.  Ambiance was great! I realized at the end of the meal this used to be Cockscomb. Great space  Definitely recommend! Look forward to coming back and trying some more things"

Sampler dip platter: 5/5 in taste but the portion of the dips was a little small. It was perfect for sharing with a group so you can try everything. The babaganoush and muhamarra were great! Tomato marmalade was unique. The pita that comes with this was sooooooooooo soft and delicious, highly recommend getting pita!! I am a vegetarian so I the zaatar carrot salad, stuffed peppers with eggplant, risotto with tofu subbed instead of egg.  Zaatar carrot salad: This dish was just fine, I probably would not recommend. The carrots were cooked well but there was not really anything inventive about it or any superstar flavors. The greens they used for the salad base were a little tough. 3/5 Rissotto: creamy, and the fried crust on the tofu was the superstar. The tofu had a great texture too. The risotto tasted good, and was nice and cheesy. A good hearty option 4/5 The stuffed eggplant peppers were just ok 3.5/5 Desserts: CHOCOLATE DONUTS OMG AND THE LEMON CAKE all incredible.

It took 45 minutes to get my first round of cocktails (2 drinks) and 1.5 hours to get the main courses. I sat at a corner table and noticed tables who were seated after me were getting their main course food first. We weren't in a rush but waiting nearly 2 hours for a main course is extremely long.  I decided to try the sampler which came with 5 dips and 3 pieces of pita bread. The bread bread was delicious - especially fresh out of the oven. However, the ratio of pita bread to dips weren't enough and they charged for additional bread ($5 for 2 pieces). For $30, there should've been more bread to begin with. Taste wise, the sampler was a solid (3.5/5).  Tried the carrot salad was not anything memorable but I wanted some greens (3/5).  The blackened cauliflower was my favorite dish of the night (4.5/5). The lamb shank was very tender but I wasn't a huge fan of the sides (beans and veggies) so I'd give it a (4/5).  Overall, I'd rate the food a 4/5 but due to the long wait and table neglect I'm docking a star. Really wanted to enjoy this spot because the inside was beautiful and the vibes were on point but I personally wouldn't dine here again"

        "Jose M.": "This review is mainly about my my overall experience with Taksim (other food reviews speak for themselves). Taksim was very accommodating. I called for a party of 13 (3 weeks ahead of time). I was able to customize my prix fixe menu (3 courses) for only $67/person. I chose option A ($60/person), but switched out the fishes (+$7). I elected to have the dorade \"heart-breaker\" instead of the branzino. They said that we could share the private room with another large party for a fraction of how much the private room would be. There was a minimum spend and we met that immediately. This reservation was completed with a $400 deposit.  My menu was: first course dips, second course polenta, dorade or chicken, third course donut or rice pudding.  The day of: two people got sick and couldn't make it, and they alerted me that in the agreement, they had full right to charge me for the people who couldn't make it, but they didn't! We came in and brought out one bottle of white wine (there is corkage fee) and we were ushered upstairs to the private dining room. The other large party was there but there was enough space not to hear them.  The food was delicious. We ordered 2 dozen oysters & the lamb carpaccio. The oysters were probably the best oysters that I have ever had! I loved the chicken but would probably order the dorade next time (amazing flavors). There were no complaints about the food or drinks. The ambiance was nice and servers were very attentive.  Taksim was a great place to have a birthday dinner. It's new and chic. A modern restaurant with a mixture of casual dining and fine dining."

We had the Pea salad which was really terrific and a large portion along with the cauliflower soup...delicious! The freshly baked bazlama bread added to this! Yum!

        "Denny D.": "Taksim has been on my radar of restaurants to try and we came came here for my partner's birthday dinner. We emailed ahead of time to make a reservation since we had a big party; they were able to accommodate us since we emailed a month in advance. You can walk in or make a reservation if you don't have a big party. This place is a hole in the wall spot. I love Mediterranean food and this place does not disappoint at all, especially the quality was top tier and the prices were not extreme. Since we had a big party, we had a set menu which consisted of 3 courses. They also allowed you to add on items that were not on the set menu. We started off with the first course of dips and pita bread; it was so delicious and very generous on the pita bread. (This was included in the set menu) We added on the olive crusted lamb carpaccio and the dozen oysters; I did not have the oyster but everyone said the oysters were fresh and tasty. The lamb carpaccio was refreshing and light, it is the perfect appetizer. For the second course, we all got to pick between the dorade (fish) or the chicken or the polenta. I chose the chicken and it was so flavorful and the chicken was juicy and it was served over a bed of quinoa. I was definitely stuffed by the end of this course. My friends who opted for the fish dish said it was delectable. Finally we finished with dessert, and for this course we had the option of Turkish donuts or raki palace pudding. All of us chose the Turkish donuts which came with a little bit of chocolate ice cream. Overall, I think this place is great for a date night or if you are going out with a group of friends. The service here is amazing. Definitely recommend to people to check out before they start becoming more and more popular."

        "Riya A.": "Taksim was an unexpected find on a last minute dinner reservation hunt, and a turned out to be a hidden gem in our very own neighborhood. Pricy for sure, but it's a worthy candidate for your once-in-a-while fine dining splurge.  Turn down a dimly lit alley at the edge of SoMa and suddenly you're greeted with the steady murmur of restaurant-goers and wine glass clinks under string lights. The restaurant has multiple intimate rooms (with 5-6 tables each) throughout the building. We got a tour as the waitstaff led us to our table. It was packed with patrons during our weekend night visit.  We started off with the $36 dip sampler for our party of two, and ordered the Eggplant Stuffed Peppers and Wheat Berry Risotto for the rest of the meal. Everything hit the mark, and I felt like we got a good variety of flavors and explored multiple sides of the menu with our choices. The waitstaff were attentive, friendly, and generous in offering us rundowns of our dishes.  The portion sizes are on the smaller size so prepare (either your stomach or your wallet) accordingly. For example, the pita sampler comes with only 3 tiny pieces of pita and every additional three pieces is $7 more, so be wary.  Perfect for a birthday dinner (a popular idea; we sang happy birthday for no less than 2 parties in our small room alone within 30 minutes), anniversaries, dates, any kind of sophisticated celebration. The waitstaff do a great job of facilitating and participating in them. Would also recommend reserving beforehand (especially for big parties)."

        "Evan G.": "An elusive hole in the wall. I was visiting SF for a work trip with my partner and this place was the obvious stand out when looking for places to eat. In the heart of Chinatown, it sits in an alley that seems unlikely for such a gem. Upon seeing the beautiful interior we knew this was the right place. We were greeted by an elegant atmosphere and a wonderful hostess, after being seated we were served by the owner of the establishment who recommended the French toast, which turned out to be better than I could have imagined. Perfectly ripe berries and beautifully caramelized bananas topped this decadant slice of brioche French toast. Paired with a side of side of sweet cream to drizzle and a cup of the richest mocha I've ever tasted, this breakfast was the perfect way to end off this trip. We will definitely return :)))"

We especially enjoyed the Harry Potter books at the top of the huge book shelves filled with encyclopedias (had a great conversation about how we used them to research for school assignments with our 23 year old daughter ). On to the food...we ordered the brioche French toast, traditional eggs Benedict and the classic breakfast with over easy eggs and the sweet n spicy bacon. The French toast is a round piece of brioche topped with a caramelized banana, blueberries, glazed pecans and some powdered sugar as well as some strawberries on the side. It comes with a vanilla cream to pour over. It was delicious! We all enjoyed it! I got it with some chicken sausage that was juicy, tender and flavorful. The house made bread that came with the classic egg breakfast was so good topped with their strawberry jam. The eggs Benedict was also delicious as were the potatoes crusted in some slightly spicy deliciousness. Our server was attentive and fun as well as efficient and quick. We were offered to go cups for our coffees and tea. We will absolutely be back!"

        "Johnny W.": "Summary: Stylish cafe with tasty brunch Details: * Menu includes your typical brunch fare (some with fancier fixins like seafood), along with a handful of non-standard items like burgers and other plated entrees, ranging from Asian to more Western * While the burgers and sandos were solid, the more standard brunch dishes like the eggs benny were particularly standout * Service is attentive and friendly, and the space itself has a really sweet vintage vibe to it (also the staff uniforms are really cute what!!) Accessibility: The restaurant is broken up into two levels, with half the venue down a fairly small step. There's a fair amount of seating and space in the half accessible via the main entrance, so you shouldn't have too much trouble here."

She is vegan so asked the egg to be left out. So there was no seasoning and just loads of basic avocado. Service needs a lot of improvement. Lot of rushing (resulting in some clumsiness) even though it wasn't that busy. They didn't have their liquor license yet, so couldn't even have any morning booze to make the meal more enjoyable. Place looks cute though. Another new place in the city for Instagrammers but not for brunch lovers!"

Regardless, it's a charming location, and the decor reminds me of french/new orleans/or quaint European . Even the background music sounds french! We shared the crispy chicken sandwich and toasted smoked salmon float. We enjoyed the french fries, fried chicken and smoked salmon! We found their homemade foccacia bread too hard around the edges for our tastes. Their extensive menu choices are quite extensive and we WILL return."

Service was a little slow on Saturday when we went, as they seemed a little understaffed. However, servers were very friendly and helpful.  I got the Numi gunpowder green tea, which came in a nice glass teapot set. It's in the details!  My entree was the basil minced chicken and rice, based on Thai flavors, was spicy and delicious, but maybe just a tad under seasoned. A perfectly crispy fried egg with a jammy yolk sat on top and saturated the rice when I broke it open. Good hangover cure.  If you want something different than the heavy brunch food (although they have that too if you fancy it), you should try this place."

I was a little surprised by how hectic it was, but I'm guessing it's more hectic on a weekend for lunch/brunch since there is a 45-minute limit on tables.  I ordered the soup and salad combination and had intended to get the salmon salad....which is the only salad that is excluded from the soup and salad combo (which isn't indicated on the menu). I ended up getting the Chinese chicken salad and the soup of the day (which was vegetarian chili). At $20, it was a solid meal, though I imagine they are better known for their brunch."

        "Alice S.": "This is a solid spot for a casual breakfast or brunch. I visited around 11am on a Saturday, when this place was somewhat busy but was still able to easily find an empty table without any wait.  I ordered a cappuccino and savory onion scone at the counter and then found a seat on the second floor while waiting for the barista to call out my drink order. The cappuccino was decent but nothing memorable. But the star of the show was the savory scone, which was flavorful, not dry or overly crumbly at all, and fairy large in size!  My friend also enjoyed his banana bread and raves about the cinnamon roll here.  One thing to note is that this Fillmore location has a nice ambiance and offers plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Meanwhile, the Geary location is only a grab and go spot but offers a greater selection (and higher quality) of baked goods."

The menu is pretty extensive with options for gluten free/vegan/dairy free customers.  I ordered a chicken shawarma bowl, gluten free toast with peanut butter and jam, a matcha latte, and a gluten free & vegan chocolate chip cookie.  Let's start off with the positives: the chicken shawarma bowl was really flavorful and the portion was generous. The gluten free bread was also really good, but I felt like $8 for a tiny slice of toast was a bit steep. The chocolate chip cookie was phenomenal and I wish I got another one for the road. The negatives: the matcha latte was disgusting. It was extremely chalky, so I'm assuming whoever made it just put way too much matcha powder in.  Aside from the latte, everything was great! This is a great place to go with a smaller group for breakfast or a late lunch."

        "Karen Y.": "First time here and this place was PACKED!  Came here on a Saturday afternoon and I could tell this was a really popular spot. There are two levels of seating so if you don't spot a table to sit on the ground floor, you can always try upstairs where it's a little quieter.  You order first at the counter if you would like to dine in and they'll come out with your order to your table. Drinks come in to-go cups (unless it's a hot drink--then a mug).  Ordered the Peruvian Chicken Rice Bowl and it was A LOT. I definitely recommend splitting it with someone because it's a really satiating bowl. The flavors were really nice and it was actually really refreshing (even though it was warm).  Definitely would want to come again--maybe on a weekday when it's less busy and try out their other items."

I got a quiche of the day (bacon and swiss) and a crazy cookie for there and say down at a table. They gave me the cookie when I paid and a number for the quiche. I waited maybe ~5 minutes for the slice. Quiche - delicious and huge portion! I actually struggled to finish it towards the end. The egg is fluffy and the crush is wonderfully crumbly. I loved the bits of bacon Crazy cookie - WOW! I originally got this to take home for my partner but I took a nibble and ended up eating the whole thing. I got a second one for him . I wasn't expecting to like this because it just seemed too sweet -- marshmallows AND chocolate in a cookie?? But I loved how the marshmallows were gooey but also tacky, almost taffy like. It gave an amazing contrast to the sharp cookie. It was a bit loud in there with a full house, but I was able to still hear the music so that was really nice. I would definitely come back for a peaceful cafe self-date with a book!"

The service was also unmemorable - staff are not warm or friendly but get the job done. The food took a while to come out.  The interior is cute and there is additional seating upstairs. Not sure I'll be back for the food but (from what I have tried at other locations) their pastries are worth getting!"

Tasting menu and a flight of infused vodkas was the move on the night of our visit. This is for sure to experience the concept of \"elevated Russian\" food.

Tried the tasting menu which a nice selection of their popular items. The perlovka was an extremely flavorful broth served with mushrooms - of which the texture was a bit off for me. The monk liver pate was balanced with the caviar. The dumpling soup was good, the squid ink pelmini was beautiful but was more of a garnish than anything else. Went with the cod as my main which was perfectly cooked  Lastly the donuts with caramel...I mean you can't really go wrong with donuts and these were no exception. Overall, a unique creation of dishes, very creative and def outside of the box for me. Great to try and least once."

I can make (much) better stroganoff (and I would use more than 3 mushrooms). It would have been less insulting if the prices were not so ridiculous ($23 for a single potato pastry?? Which was literally recommended by multiple servers as the best thing on the menu?? What??) Also, I'm fine with automatic tipping (20%) but this could easily be overlooked on the check and the final bill has a line asking for \"additional tip.\" Other restaurants are up-front about uncommon tipping approaches instead of trying to slip it under the customers radar. Come on."

        "Min K.": "This review is long overdue! I just saw that Chef Anya won Chef of the Year so I had to also share my experiences at this gem of a restaurant. I've dined here twice: for their caviar service (they have their own private label) and their a la carte menu (changes seasonally). Definitely will be back to try their vegan tasting menu which everyone is raving about. Every time I walk through the front door I feel instantly transported to a beautiful place, probably from the elegant murals and art displays that line the dining room and private patio but also due the hospitality that is felt so deeply here.  My husband and I have tasted the most unique flavors and ingredients at Birch & Rye, they source so intentionally -- everything has a story, a reason, a purpose. Like almond wood smoked sturgeon, or rye doughnuts with caramel and caviar (such a fun pairing), wagyu cheek with spiced buckwheat, rye bread with delicious smetana butter, or a faberge cauliflower egg cloud! Also, sea buckthorn! I have fallen in love with this traditional berry, thank you chefs! Just as powerful as the food, their beverage program is exquisite with Eastern European wines, wonderful Champagnes aaaand house-made infused vodkas! What a phenomenal line. Linden flower, strawberry rose, black currant, orange pine apricot, and there's more. Try. Them. All. You can tell they invested so much time and energy into every single one. My favorite was the spicy horseradish; I purchased a jar of it go and took it to a party and it was such a hit!  Can't wait to return and try their new menu! Most of all, thank you for this modern and romantic presentation of Russian culture and Eastern European traditions."

        "Jocelyn K.": "I hate leaving a new restaurant a terrible review but this place feels like a highway robbery. I say this as someone who has traveled to other countries just to eat at Michelin star places!  I was super excited to try this place since I have been obsessed with Khachapuri ever since I had it in this amazing Georgian restaurant in Washington DC. Since there was no place in SF that served Khachapuri, I had to travel to Palo Alto to get my fix. Therefore, I was SUPER excited for birch and rye to open. I have been following the restaurant for months before it open and made a reservation way before it even opened for the first day of brunch.  When I got there, I was disappointed to find out that birch and rye did not serve Khachapuri for brunch. Oh well, no matter, I would just have to come back during dinner and try it. I looked at the brunch menu and the prices were pretty expensive. I asked the waitress what she recommend and she said that the duck egg was good.  When I got my dish I couldn't believe it. They literally charge $27 not including tax and tip for a SINGLE COLD DUCK EGG and a piece of bread. Like what the f... I was expecting something more substantial for $27. I can't believe they would charge that for A SINGLE COLD EGG. The egg wasn't even that good. I saw another table has the cured salmon and that was literally three skimpy sashimi size pieces of salmon for $23!!! I have never left a restaurant feeling so hungry and ripped off.  I think birch and rye really needs to reevaluate their price for what they are offering. I was really hoping to experience the joy of eating at a new restaurant again. However, this experience emphasized to me how ridiculous some new restaurants in San Francisco have gotten. We are in the midst of an economic crisis and here they are charging $27 for a single cold egg... I don't know if I will ever feel up to trying the Khachapuri after this but if I do, I will update my review. EDIT: While I appreciate Maria trying to look at the bright side of my review. I do not think that the \"caviar\" in this dish justifies the price at all. First, this is not the traditional sturgeon (black) caviar that is normally very expensive. If it was then I think the price would be worth it. Instead, this is salmon roe which is very inexpensive (salmon roe aka ikura tends to be one of the cheapest options at a sushi restaurant). I do not think that the ikura in this dish makes it worth $27 at all and I hope that while the restaurant is reevaluating and changing their menu, they readjust their prices to something more reasonable for what they are serving."

The atmosphere, food and drinks are all phenomenal. The entrance in a fun little pawn shop, so be ready with a trinket or joke for entry. The staff is amazing and so fun.  DRINKS: this is a wine bar so they have a great variety of bottles and wine by the glass. I did spy a few cocktails on the menu, but we stuck to the wine.  FOOD: everything we ordered was delicious. Come hungry so you can try ALLL the tapas. *Pickled Vegetables *Jamon Serrano *Cheese Plater *Patatas Bravas *Pulpo a La Plancha- octopus melted in your mouth *Carne a La Plancha con Migas- perfectly seasoned *Churros As soon as we left, I was already on Yelp making another reservation. I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK! You should definitely check out The Pawn Shop."

        "Christina T.": "A super amazing experience! If you are looking to impress a first date or come here with friends, I think this is a cool spot to visit. Located on the SOMA streets, you might have passed by this place without a second glance. It's has a small street entrance and the pawn shop looks deceivingly small. You have to ask the store attendant that you want to dine at the pawn shop and they will start an interesting banter with you before you gain entry. Fair warning: You need to bring something to pawn/exchange for entry to the restaurant. I came here with nothing to exchange and had to tell a joke or fun fact. It puts you on the spot but its all for fun.  While I wont divulge how to enter, the restaurant is ginormous once you gain entry. There are two floors and a huge bar area. We sat upstairs and it is so cutely decorated inside.  The food was delicious but a bit pricey. We had the corn ribs which were delicious. I ended up loving them so much I learned how to make them at home. We also got the charcuterie platter which I would suggest skipping if you come hungry. It is cute for tapas and just a great place to have a conversation while sipping on drinks."

        "Claire L.": "Such a cute spot! The front is a real pawn shop and you should trade something in for entrance to the restaurant - it can be a physical trinket, or a joke, or a life story.  Ambiance and decor inside felt trendy but classy. Service was great and our waiter was very sweet, it felt like the people working there were having a good time.  We got: - patatas bravas 10/10 must get - gazpacho 9/10 it's a teeny cup but very flavorful - ensalada de melon y pepino 9/10 very refreshing - habichuelas con berejena 8/10 a bit too sour for me but still quite good - churros 10/10 very rich decadent chocolate and crispy chewy cinnamony churros My partner also got the uno cocktail which was fruity and delicious. I tried sherry for the first time which tasted abhorrent, but that's on me.  Their website menu was a bit outdated so they didn't have items like the garlic shrimp which I was hoping to get, but still a great dinner. Highly recommend making reservations in advance!"

Entering The Pawn Shop, you will be greeted by the pawn master where you will have to pawn/sell an item to go through hidden entrance - I must say, it's one of the coolest hidden entrances into a speakeasy/tapas bar I've been to. The vibes are definitely lively and if you're lucky, you'll get to enjoy live music! We came here after dinner so we ordered a couple bite and drinks and lounged for about an hour before heading through another secret hallway to Monarch's. Definitely worth visiting both The Pawn Shop and Monarchs if you're looking to bar hop."

The service there was great as well, the waters were refilled all the time and we were checked by the waiter frequently to ensure that we got what we needed. I loved the tapas idea, so we had small plates of different things that were overall really good!  To be frank, I definitely enjoyed the drinks a little more than the food. They had a variety of different cocktails! My friend drank the seasonal cocktail which was a spiced wine, it was warmed and was perfect for the cold rainy night at the time! Would definitely come back for the experience and drinks with friends!"

The kung pao chicken was also great and had the perfect amount of spice (loved the peppercorn!). The portions were a bit smaller than expected. I was expecting a bit more protein but it was probably half protein half vegetables. Despite this, the meal was still delicious! The food comes out pretty quickly (you order at the counter and they bring the food out to you), so it's perfect for a casual lunch.

        "Kelsey X.": "Food (3/5) TikTok convinced me to come here, to my detriment. I couldn't help myself with the punny Mandarin name! My mouth had a difficult time with the Sweet & Spicy Chicken Sandwich, as the breading on the chicken cut up the inside of my mouth and the small amount of very very sweet sauce (like sweet and sour sauce) did not counter effectively. The pineapple bun was an overly sweet addition and crumbled under my fingertips with each bite. It was a losing battle, Man vs. Food, with my architecturally unstable bun and too-crunchy chicken both embracing new residences on the table. It made me sentimental for Chick-Fil-A. My other friends got the Kung Pao Chicken, Broccoli & Beef, and West Lake Beef Soup, which were easier to eat but portion-wise not a large amount. It was giving Panda Express, in a more millennial-forward fashion. Perhaps the most authentic item we got was the West Lake Beef Soup. Price (4/5) Price-wise is ok. If you get the Sweet & Spicy Chicken Sandwich it is relatively affordable ($10) but other entrees are more than $15 for a small amount. Wait Time (3/5) Took about 15 mins for all our food to come out, which was surprising considering how \"easy\" the food is to assemble. Came on at Saturday lunchtime and there was no wait. You pay at the counter then take a seat, it is self-serve but wait staff bring the food to your table based on which number you take. There are water, cups, utensils. Ambience (5/5) Interior wall is beautiful, seats could be a little more comfortable. Bathroom is clean, large, and has a nice mirror. Service (5/5) Friendly cashier who helped my group decide what to get and explained the items. Parking/Access (4/5) Pretty easy to find street parking in the area. You may have to walk a bit, but you will find a spot. Overall, this place is Mamahuhu in both ways. It's just ok, and makes think of what my Mom would say: \"I could have made better food at home\"."

Quality/Quantity - Simple menu done well. Jade Fried Rice - Least impressive of the 3 dishes. And the least amount of quantity. Especially for $10. Kung Pao Chicken - Fresh, good flavors and textures. Family style, and with decent quantity. You also have the option for rice plates which is $2 cheaper. Mapo Tofu With Pork - This was the favorite, GREAT flavors and textures, especially the silken tofu. Also generous portions. You also have the option for rice plates which is $2 cheaper. Next time, I will try your signature item; spicy chicken sandwich and boba soft serve...? Atmosphere - Open 7 days a week from 11:30am to 9pm. Street parking, good luck; we got lucky and got a space right in front. Small cool new location, cool decor, see pictures. Service - Counter service, okay. Nice, friendly and did everything we asked. But nothing more. Price - $48 + generous tip. $48 includes the 4% SF Health Mandate and the 1% Zero \"Foodprint\" charges. Owner Comment - Congrats on your 3 locations. I think this is your first one, open in 2020...? Very aggressive growth plan."

It's casual cafe style where you order at the counter, get a number, and they'll bring the food to your table. They also have an outdoor area which can accommodate several 2-people parties. Overall the food was so-so, just like the meaning of the restaurant name. I gave one extra star because of the friendly staff and nice indoor environment. - the sweet and spicy chicken sandwich: the bun was quite unique - they used the Cantonese style pineapple bread. The fried chicken was crispy. The flavor was sweet and citrusy. I didn't sense the spicy part of it though. Overall, it's a solid chicken sandwich, different from the norm. - Mapo tofu plate with upgraded jade fried rice: I would recommend to pair Mapo tofu with white rice instead because both items were quite salty. I think they adjusted the Mapo tofu to more broad audience. To me, I would prefer it to have more numbness taste. - chrysanthemum salad: another dish I've never had before. It's a refreshing dish and more on the tart side."

I hate writing bad reviews about places that serve Taiwanese cuisine but this place really just did not live up to my expectations.  Walked in at 2pm on a Saturday, no line! Really pleasant modern decor.  Asked the cashier what they recommended, and I decided to get the sweet and sour 1/2 cauliflower + 1/2 chicken rice plate. Oh man....the sourness of the sauce almost made me cry. And the veggies didn't even taste fully cooked! Prices were average and on par with what you'd expect to pay for SF. But come on...a basic sweet and sour sauce you can't even do right?  Sigh.  I want to support but doubt I'll come back unless I had no choice."

I really wanted to try the Dashpass exclusive Capital Curry Chow Mein because curry powder in your chow mein...a concept...and yes it did deliver!!

Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad.. it's just not remarkable.  SWEET AND SOUR CHICKEN RICE PLATE: Chicken is nice and crispy, the sauce is sweet and sour, but the bell peppers with it felt like they were prepared separately and added in later as they were cold compared to the chicken. Just a disappointing bite.  WEST LAKE BEEF SOUP: comforting and warm on a cold day, silky tofu texture and the crumbles of beef add some nice flavor. Unfortunately, felt a bit sick after finishing this bowl.  I don't think I'll be back, but props to the interior designer!"

I ordered the sweet & sour chicken, cucumber salad, broccoli & shrooms and the tomato garlic chow mein. We still had leftovers for the next night's dinner! Plenty of food but what I like about this spot is plenty of veggies in every dish. All their meat dishes had veggies even the chow mein was stuffed with bell peppers. Colorful dishes, good tasting food, my appetite is revved up for this casual spot!"

It's obviously a step down from the more upscale Chinese food in the city, but still worth the visit for a quick meal.  The Rice Plates are pretty affordable and come with a decent amount of food. I got the Sweet & Sour Chicken Rice Plate, which came with a generous portion of chicken. The sweet & sour sauce did not skimp out on the flavor, and the chicken was very crunchy. We also got the Egg Rolls and the West Lake Beef Soup. The Egg Rolls were great and pretty standard. The soup was hearty and tasty, though it wasn't what we expected. It was more like ground beef in a thick stew. My friend got the Mapo Tofu, which seems like a popular option, though it is pretty freaking spicy.  I think they may have forgotten about my friend's Mapo Tofu initially because that took forever to come out and we had to remind them. They brought it out pretty soon afterwards though."

The bread was no soggy or softened and then chicken katsu was still crispy and juicy.  There aren't that many spots in SF for Japanese sandos that I can think of, so it's nice to have a couple options that are within a reasonable distance, especially since I absolutely love Japanese sandos. My sandwich was delicious; as mentioned, the bread and chief retained their appropriate textures and consistencies. I also really enjoyed the slaw and pickles added into the sandwich that provided another level of texture as well as a fresher and acidic component to the dish.  One thing to note is that these sandos definitely aren't cheap. It's about $17 but it has a good quality so I feel it's justified. Definitely a go to spot in my book!"

Truly though that sandwich with a side of curry sauce is the epitome of a delicious and well balanced taste profile that many more should enjoy. I'm also a sucker for good miso soup which Cafe Okawari has as well. I've always been welcomed by polite and attentive staff who seem to love where they work.

        "Andrew M.": "I can say without any hyperbole applied that Cafe Okawari serves the best chicken katsu sando on the West Coast of the USA. It is perfect: light, fluffy but ample milk bread, tangy tonkatsu sauce, and perfectly cooked, lightly breaded and juicy chicken in-between - I've never tasted a better version of the standard (And that might even include Japan itself!) Cafe Okawari itself is a simple and unassuming spot near the Giants ballpark. From the outside looking in you'd probably miss it if you're weren't specifically looking for it and once you peer into the interior it's unlikely to make much of an impression. But if you check out the menu, you'll likely be intrigued by the various Japanese comfort food items on the list.  I've tried a few other things here and all good. The side salad that comes with the sandwich is simple, fresh, and delicious, complimented with a sesame dressing that appears equal parts citrus (maybe grapefruit? Can't quite place it!) and is the perfect accompaniment. Coffee is really good here too!"

        "Joan W.": "I come here for the chicken katsu sandwiches, I love them with their aesthetic look and fluffy Japanese milk bread. There aren't too many other places in the city that do chicken katsu and Caf Okawari is the only one that gives you a generous helping of pickles on top which I like. I recommend getting it with the salad because the dressing is really good. I'm not sure what's in it but it very tangy, maybe something soy sauce based.  This place is very close to the Caltrain station and Oracle Park. It' is a little hard to find parking but the easiest I've found is on nearby Bluxome street."

        "Natalie L.": "This is a small, very chill cafe where the food is pretty great. Cafe Okawari essentially gets the Japanese basics right--Japanese curry with a sweet-ish sauce and a perfectly crisp katsu (along with pickled radish, which I think you won't find at a heavily Americanized place that serves curry), and the egg salad was sandwiched between pieces of perfectly fluffy milk bread. Service was fine, considering it's a cafe where you order and pay up front, and get utensils and water yourself. Sometimes you just don't want to hound someone down for water while they're in the middle of taking an order."

        "Cat C.": "I first went to Cote Ouest in April during SF Restaurant Week. We enjoyed it so much that we went back for brunch in the summer. Both times I've enjoyed their outdoor seating with the use of their heaters.  If you have the opportunity to try their blood orange and crab salad, you must! The dressing was light, and the crab was plentiful. I loved the creaminess from the avocado too. It's a great value during SFRW given that the salad was on the dinner menu for over $30 a la carte. Onto the steak frites, I didn't know what to expect with the peppercorn sauce, but it wasn't overpowering and complimented the filet well. There were a few parts of the steak that were a little less tender, but overall, a great steak. It was cooked perfectly medium rare, and we loved the perfectly crisped and seasoned frites. We were getting so full that we packed up a ton of the fries. Since we wanted to try two different desserts, we ordered one molten chocolate lava cake and one creme brle. Both had us \"ohhing and awwing\", and of course the lava cake was decadent.  A few months later, I was wanting a brunch in the city. And we chose the outdoor parklet with the heaters on for the three of us to have brunch. My little guy, the picky eater that he is, was all for just the fries. My husband tried their burger, and I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict. My LO loved the fries, so that's all that matters, but I felt when we had them with our steak during Restaurant week, they were more seasoned then. The smoked salmon Benedict was served over a thick piece of toast with pesto sauce in addition to the hollandaise, and a side of potatoes. While, I love pesto, and eggs Benny isn't a true Benny without hollandaise, the combination of the two made this dish really rich. I definitely had to share some bites. Hubs enjoyed his huge burger as well.  Cote Ouest Bistro is a super cute and delicious bistro serving comforting brunch and dinner dishes at very reasonable prices. It's on the cusp of Presidio and Marina, with neighborhood parking that isn't too tough. While, Cherylynn's review of a delightful foie gras bonbons is what intrigued me to visit, which was off the menu during both visits, this is still a great neighborhood gem that satisfies my French cuisine craving. 4.5 stars rounded up."

If you add the course al la carte, it is actually cheaper and you would have more choices. We had the crab salad (only thing that is not on the regular menu), escargot as first course. The crab salad has decent amount of crab and the tarragon dressing was light and delicious. The escargot came under a pastry top. It is not the best that I ever had but was decent. Main course was duck confit and mussels. Duck was tender. Dessert were chocolate lava cake and the one that came with the SF week menu. I enjoyed the lava cake more. All in all, pretty good meal."

We barely started with our food. Mixed good results: 10/10 mussels. Very juicy, fresh, delicious. 3/10 burger. Over cooked and just extremely underwhelming. The sauce had no taste and the medium burger that was supposed to be medium rare was under salted. I don't think I'd ever pay to eat here again.

It was very buttery and did melt in my mouth 2/4 Moules and frites - the Moules were a bit bland and the sauce for the fries were the best part. Dipping the bread in here wasn't enjoyable 2/4 Risotto - topped with pomegranate and also was pretty bland 3/4 Cauliflower - topped with blue cheese and pomegranate. I probably liked this the most.

I ordered the Croque Madam. The portions were huge. It came with a simple french salad and french fries (with a aioli dipping sauce). Hubs ordered the omelet w/asparagus, mushrooms and goat cheese - comes with potatoes with loads of whole roasted garlic cloves (we counted 5 big pieces!) I had an entire half sandwich to take home and enjoy the next day. My super minor quibble was that the egg wasn't quite runny. BUT with the current prices of eggs a $2 uncharge was very reasonable.

        "Jenny W.": "Brunch is pretty overpriced for what it is. You're paying for the prime location and ambiance. I got the mushroom frittata, which was fine but pretty basic. The latkes were nice to share. Drinks with snacks is a better move here. The inside is a bit dark and trendy, and they've got a large bar seating area where you can chat and linger. The bartenders are great - the custom cocktail they made for me was excellent, I wish I knew what they put in it so I could get it again. Food wise:  The octopus tostada is an interesting concept but it doesn't really work well when you're trying to eat it. The crispy tostada breaks into smaller pieces and your left trying to finish it all quickly so the pieces don't fall apart. The kabocha tempura was good but nothing mindblowing, I think I would have wanted the inside a bit softer to contrast with the crispy outside.  The duck carbonara seems to be the thing to get - it's got a rich flavor of duck - although carbonara isn't really my thing, so this isn't really my dish."

Its situated next to a blocked off walkway where there is essentially a parade of dogs that walk by so, talk about entertainment!

Hayes has a very nice, laid back vibe to it. I came here on a Thursday around 5 pm and it wasn't very difficult getting a reservation, but by the time I was leaving this place was getting packed.  I ordered the the Dazzler since I like vodka based cocktails, the Dazzler had a very refreshing taste with the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I must say that the drinks here were strong which I appreciate. My friend got the Flower Child and even she enjoyed her drink.  The service was quick and attentive, most of the servers had a smile on their face which is great. Price wise also this place is quite affordable.  I would love to come back here for food next time which looked quite epic."

The service was A1 which deserves 5 stars on it's own. Ordered some brunch appropriate drinks like a Bloody Mary and a Bellini. The Bellini was alright because of the guava but the Bloody wasn't so great. It had a bitter taste because of the mixer but it was dressed up well. We were killing time and wanted a light snack vs grab meals so we wanted to check out the latkes on the menu. They were a little thick - a little thinner and I think they'd be perfect. Unique and delicious sauces to pair with it."

I've been about 5 times and a month ago I saw a dog in the bar and they said it's dog friendly in the bar. I went back with my pouch and even shared the treats I brought her with the patron sitting next to me and his dog. I walked in with two little cockapoos on Sunday and was reprimanded by a manger saying (in a disgusted tone) dogs are not allowed in the restaurant. I was surprised and said I was just in and he cut me off to let me know he's been there for a long time and dogs have never been allowed. We could have sat outside but I was not compelled to spend my money there so went someplace else. It's a bummer because I live in Hayes Valley and dine out often. I won't be going back based solely on this very uncomfortable interaction"

We met a fourth friend there, who waited around 5-10 minutes I believe to secure a table. The ambiance is super cute - definitely a trendy spot. The food was good, but in my opinion, the whole experience has a bit of room for improvement.  I ordered the latkes, which came without the apple sauce :( And the corn bread, which was delicious. I actually had to order the corn bread because I was still hungry after the latkes - the portion size was very small and not quite worth the ~$16 I paid. The waitress was okay. Overall, I would come back just for the cornbread lol but would prefer to try a different place. This would also be a good place for some morning cocktails if you're into that!"

The \"crispy\" new potatoes had a grainy, split Brie sauce that tastes better than it looks.  The pastrami hash was also just ok. The egg was a great sunny side up, but the hash was too salty and not at all crispy. Just a very wet mix of out of season vegetables and meager amounts of chopped pastrami. I won't be rushing back. But, the service was ok and the drinks menu was really enticing!"

        "Brunella C.": "Disappointed. There was no host in sight or any sign to know if you should wait to be seated or not. After a few minutes I asked to a waiter and the host appeared. Then he moved a party close to us using the extra stool for our friend that was late. No big deal, grabbed another. No hangers under the tables. Bring your hook! Service was just ok. Like 40min for 2 simple drinks. It felt waiters didn't know where to go with the orders, very disorganized. When we were ordering with our waitress, the party next to us called her and she told us to wait a second. What?  Drink: Cosnopolitan. It was good! 4/5 Most of the cocktails have tequila or mezcal. I don't like that alcohol so I had the mocktail. I wish they had more options. The food. Solid 3.5 The lamb meatballs were good. 4/5 The latkes just ok. Lot of oil, overcooked but the flavor was good. 3/5 Desserts. Skip those. Bread pudding. 3/5 It was good except for the sated caramel sauce. I don't understand this obsession of using salt. Pavlova. 1/5 First of all, it was chewy. Then it didn't taste like meringue at all. The saffron ice cream was too sweet. The praline was like a ball, it needs to be smaller. Then the sauce on the plate was weird, didn't like it. Under the pavlova the date cream was good but the grapefruit? This dessert is not well balanced and it has an identity problem.  Chocolate cake was the best. 4/5 Rich chocolate. 2 scoops of mint ice cream. One is enough in my opinion. Nice flavor. I suggest to organize a little bit better the service, add a sign to know if people should wait at the entrance to be seated or not, and change that pavlova dessert. I guess is fine if you only come for drinks. I had a nice time because I was with my friends. I guess is a hit or miss. Sadly, it was a miss for me and I won't comeback."

Left feeling extremely full  Spoke with the friendly staff, they told me they use more veggies (cucumber, tomato, lettuce) than typically because it's what more people here tend to want in a sandwich. Added some freshness and depth of flavor. Coming back with my gf soon since she likes pickles! Gonna try the chicken or gyro, or maybe a plate."

Around $13.99 for the salad and it was worth because portion size was pretty big! I've also tried the sandwiches and their wraps. Lamb shawarma is amazing and in their sandwiches, I LOVE LOVE LOVE their pesto made in-house. Always will be coming back here  Service: always friendly and helpful. I'm pretty indecisive while choosing what I want to eat, so whoever is in the front always helps me decide what I want to eat.

While the sushi has inflated in price like all other spots in SF, I feel like it's difficult to find a $15.49 2 item bento like Kui Shin Bo has. This time I got it with the California roll and chicken Katsu, and I split the okonomiyaki with my friends. I was so full I barely even touched the katsu, but that was perfectly crispy and standard. The okonomiyaki was also crunchy, topped with chicken and the right sauces that made it sweet, salty, and umami! While the wait is always ~30 minutes and you have to join through the Yelp waitlist once you get there, your party is sure to find something they enjoy from the extensive menu. It's not a super large restaurant and the waiters aren't the most attentive, but it's a reliable spot that I would come back to."

I love the pricing of the cheap lunch special. I was stuffed after my lunch special. The udon noodles I would give a 9/10 and the udon broth (this is veggie) I would give a 8.5/10 still a good udon! And did the trick for me. With the tempura the pieces were a bit harder for me than I like the texture for tempura for me so this might just be a one time thing. So I would give the veggie tempura a 6.5/10. I wished it was a bit softer inside and not so freshly hard esp with the lotus and sweet potato. The place looks great and I like the japantown feel of the place. Overall a 7.5/10 experience for me if the tempura was done a bit longer and not so hard I would give it a higher rating."

I'm a huge fan of bento boxes because I like to have a variety of flavors in one meal and they had a deal for a 2-item box for $15.88  My go to is always pork tonkatsu and beef teriyaki when it comes to bento boxes. The beef teriyaki was pretty average, meat a bit tough, but edible enough for me to finish it. The tonkatsu was tasty, good meat to breading ratio. Miso soup, standard, and salad with sesame dressing, can never go wrong. I think for the price and being in SF, to get a 2-item bento box for under $20 is a decent enough of deal in 2022. Checks the box for quick and affordable lunch in the Japantown area."

There's a tablet in front where you can enter the waitlist. We ordered the Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura, Caterpillar Roll, 49er Roll, Seafood Okonomiyaki and the Squid Maruyaki. Everything tasted pretty fresh and well made. The Okonomiyaki was my favorite dish as they make it extra crispy, unlike more soggier and saucier ones I've had before.

We ordered the negihama roll, miso corn butter ramen, and the chirashi zushi sushi. The food came out quickly. I had been really craving sushi, so the chirashi bowl hit the spot. The variety of fish was delicious and fresh, and the portions were generous. The miso corn butter ramen was tasty but a bit too rich for me. You could taste both the corn and the butter in the broth, and it smelled heavenly.  Overall, a lovely gem in Japantown with fresh food and good value - I'll definitely be visiting again!"

Especially the ramen, its on par with like the shops that only specialize on ramen. Highly recommend the spicy cheesy ramen (medium spice)!

You order and pay at the counter, and they'll find a place for you to sit. The menu is fairly small if you're looking for breakfast foods like eggs and such, but it has all the classics!  I ordered the shrimp omelette and the cinnamon French toast to share. The omelette was fairly big, and it came with potatoes and toast. I loved that the omelette had tons of shrimp, enough that you'd have a piece of shrimp with every bite. The French toast was also really good! It came with fresh kiwi and banana. I also got to try a little bit of the corned beef hash, and it was pretty good! It's not overly salty like at other restaurants.  Parking might be difficult since there's only metered street parking.

The menu had an impressive selection of choices that catered to various dietary needs and preferences. I opted for the fresh fruit waffle and was blown away by how delicious it was. The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and the fresh fruit toppings were the perfect complement. To wash it down, I tried the mango energy smoothie which was both refreshing and energizing. And for a savory option, I ordered the fried cauliflower which was crispy and flavorful. Throughout my dining experience, the service was exceptional. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, and made sure that our experience was top-notch.

So flavorful and delicious, this was probably my favorite out of everything we got Prosciutto pizza: I love prosciutto on pizza so I had to get this! Because it was thin crust, the pizza wasn't too heavy which was good since our pasta dishes were pretty heavy! The crust was also so fluffy and thick, which I love in a crust One thing that surprised me is that there was no complimentary bread We did outdoor dining, they had heaters out as well as blankets on each chair so we were still able to stay warm and the ambiance was great."

Tagliatelle alla Bolognese ($20)- This was my friends favorite! Bolognese was good, though I felt the noodles were slightly over cooked. Good portion size!  Burrata & Coppa ($22)- This pizza was my favorite of the night! I liked that the saltiness balanced out by the cheese and the little bit of a crunch from the walnuts. Crust is definitely a little flimsier. Was curious about the yellow tomato sauce- definitely a lighter sauce. One of the more unique pizzas I've had (that being said, I usually just get a funghi pizza haha).  Tiramisu ($9)- This was also really good! Super light and not too heavy like some tiramisu ends up being. Definitely one of the better ones in SF. We also went with one of the recommended wines for $13 a glass, which was fine.  Overall, food was good. Atmosphere is very loud, so it can be a bit hard to hear each other. I did feel a bit rushed at the end as she gave us our check right when our dessert arrived (to be fair probably really busy), but otherwise service was fine. Would definitely come back!"

        "Rochelle S.": "Very cute new spot here on Union street! I've been wanting to try this spot for a bit ever since I noticed their cute outdoor tables on the street. We put our name in around 7pm on Thursday, and it took us about an hour to be seated. The best items we had were the diavola pizza and the ribeye steak (huge steak!). I got the ziti genovese, and unfortunately I was not very impressed. Our service was great though, and our waiter was working the room! Also, the custom and colorful table wear adds a fun touch. One thing I'd change is how extremely loud the restaurant is. I know it's busy, but the music was loud, and with everyone talking, we were all shouting just to hear one another."

        "Jenn M.": "While the restaurant's decor and interior design were impressive and created a welcoming atmosphere, the food was disappointing. The Polpette (meatballs) were priced at $16 for just four meatballs, which were small and poorly shaped, resembling those made by a child in their grandma's kitchen. Additionally, the meatballs lacked the quality expected in a restaurant. The Fried Brussels Sprouts were overly greasy and the inside was overcooked, making it a less-than-appetizing dish. The Chitarra Cacio e Pepe al Tartufo was mediocre and served with a heavy sauce that had begun to congeal by the time it reached the table. The squid ink pasta was decent, but the portion size was small for the price of $24 and came with only four tiny clams, which seemed insufficient. Despite the underwhelming food we ordered, the prosciutto pizza at the next table looked promising and might be worth trying on a future visit. The service was good, with friendly and accommodating waitresses."

You just need to show up which can take 1+ hours to wait so I recommend showing up for an early dinner to avoid the line. We arrived at 7:30pm and didn't get seated until 9:30!! The wait was definitely worth it. (Really!). The restaurant itself is small/intimate and the service was so attentive and friendly. Now the food. I ordered Spicy Tori Paitan Ramen. So creamy and flavorful. The crispy mushrooms with the ginger and dark green vegetables made it sooooo flavorful. I added an egg too to my ramen. I would have eaten the whole thing if it weren't for the appetizers which were also so unique and delicious. We got the spicy corn wings and enoki mushroom chips! Wonderful experience and would definitely come here again when in SF."

        "Howell L.": "Came here around 8 PM on a Friday night and the place was fairly busy. It doesn't have much seating so there was a pretty short line outside you had to wait in to get in. On the window, there is a sign requesting that you eat within an hour if there are guests waiting outside. I showed up with a party of 10, and we worried they might not have enough seating for us. The tables are cleverly designed to have removable frosted glass separations, and they got us all seated around one table close to the door. We were seated on tall stools with no back. Before we were seated, they had already set out ten water glasses for us. They had a low hanging large, red paper lantern that one of the taller members of our party couldn't comfortably sit beside, but we switched seats around and were fine. In the corners of the table are little QR codes where you can see the menu and order. Over the speakers, they play pleasant music to accompany eating. The restaurant did get a little loud with so many people talking, but it wasn't unmanageable. A friend of mine has a sesame allergy and gluten intolerance, so we had to ask if it were possible to have the mochi noodle dish made without roasted sesame. When I approached a server, I was directed to another server who went into the back to check. She came back out and took the order personally from my friend to ensure the dish was made safely as there was no in-built option to opt out of the sesame within the online menu. I got the matcha ramen and my boyfriend got the tori paitan ramen. They were both delicious with creamy silky broths and perfectly cooked pork chashu. The dried things on top were a little tough in some places, but nice to eat. The kale was perfectly massaged and delicious. The matcha flavor in the matcha ramen wasn't overpowering, but was definitely present in every bite leading to a very smooth, creamy dish. I personally prefer stronger flavors and found the strong garlic flavor of the Tori Paitan broth tastier. However, this is a personal preference and I think both dishes were excellent.  To eat the ramen, you have an incredibly large soup spoon -- like a flat ladle -- and a pair of chopsticks on top of a ceramic dish you can rest your utensils on between bites. It was really satisfying to sip the broth from the large spoon. I was jealous of the other tables that ordered the fried enoki and added it to their ramens, but I knew that the ramen was already going to be too much for my partner and I, so we didn't order any appetizers. The portions were just small enough to not really be splittable but just large enough that we didn't finish our dishes. My boyfriend and I also split a yuzu soda which came with a paper straw and was delicious. After we finished eating and were talking for awhile, a server very politely came and asked if we needed to-go containers. They have very quality containers perfect for containing the leftover soups and ramens."

        "Vinkin Ken T.": "Came here on a Tuesday 2 minutes before opening. There was no line. The restaurant can seat about 25 people comfortably plus more with extra seats if you squeeze in. By the time we finished eating, 20 minutes later, there was still no line. So definitely recommend coming during the weekday at opening. This was my 2nd visit here. The last time I was here was when they first opened. I prefer pork broth ramen over chicken broth which is why I haven't been back. On my recent visit I wanted to try the matcha ramen only because I've recently seen one featured on YouTube from Japan and wanted to compare it when I go visit later this year.  Ordering was easy. Scan the QR code and place your order on the site and check out. So no waiting involved except for the food preparation. They take payments via the Square app so best to have your credit card info already saved ahead of time. An automatic 18% service charge is added for tip.  The ramen came out pretty quick. I was in and out of there in about 20 minutes. I could smell the matcha powder sprinkled on top. The broth itself had matcha but it was light. Definitely had more chicken flavor. I wish the basic bowl itself came with a few more ingredients, and yes I know I could pay extra to add. I would have preferred my noodles cooked Al dente. The burdock root was something I haven't had before. I liked when it was crispy but when soaked in the broth it became chewy.  There is a mochi noodle ramen on the menu that I almost tried. Maybe next time?"

        "Krithika S.": "Waited in line for an hour and went in with high expectations, which were sadly not met. I ordered vegan tantanmen, which came with a creamy broth that was too heavy without a lot of flavor. Was unable to finish half the bowl. Best part of the meal was the enoki mushroom fries, utterly delicious. But the ramen - too thick and heavy."
      },
      {
        "Amie S.": "Order the Tori Paitan ramen! I really enjoyed the slightly creamy and flavorful broth that accompanied the noodles so well.  I honestly didn't enjoy the fried enoki mushrooms as much as I thought I would, I feel like I was missing most of the enoki mushroom taste and was eating more of a fried thin batter. The GKO ramen was pretty spicy for me and was harder to enjoy the whole thing because of the intense garlic flavor. However if you love garlic and a nice kick to foods, give it a try. The wait for this ramen restaurant took about 40 minutes and there isn't much seating inside the restaurant. Most of the good parts of ramen including the egg come at an extra cost. If I came here again, I'd stick to ordering the Tori Paitan!"

        "Austin Y.": "Tori Paitan Ramen (7/10): This ramen was unique but not spectacular for its price point. Enoki Mushroom Chips (7.5/10): These chips were well seasoned and crispy, but started to taste oily after a while. This restaurant is well themed and decorated, and isn't too loud for discussions. Service was fast, we were seated immediately on a weekday night and could order through our phones."

        "Arya N.": "I first started coming here when it opened back in 2016. I keep returning whenever I'm in town, because it's truly the best ramen I've ever had.  The restaurant itself is small, and holds fewer than 30 customers. As a result, there is oftentimes a wait to get inside, with a line stretching halfway down the block. Depending on the time and day, you might end up waiting for an hour (or maybe even longer). The best way to reduce your wait time is to arrive maybe 15-20 minutes before opening to wait outside. Even then, you are likely to see a line of customers.  This place lives up to the hype simply because the food quality is superb. The quality has also remained consistent throughout the years. I like to order the Tantanmen (vegetarian) with an egg and extra noodles. Portion sizes are generous. The toppings and flavors all complement each other as well. If you like ramen, then I recommend trying this place!"

        "Soon Tani M.": "Overhyped. I came here again on Valentine's Day with my boyfriend for our second time and it was just as disappointing as the first.  Appetizers// Spicy enoki chips: Seemed like they just put it directly into the bowl from the fryer with no time to drip off excess oil. There was a pool on the bottom of the bowl and it just mainly tasted of oil.  A5 wagyu nigiri: WHY would you put heavy sauce on A5??? The sakura daikon on the side was more interesting and really delicious and floral.  Main// G.K.O: The garlic flavor tastes extremely burnt and bitter. The noodles were a good texture and the chashu is good.  Spicy Tsukemen: The broth is good and the noodles were bouncy. I get that Mensho usually has extensive toppings but a whole piece of fried chicken seemed too much. I also got extra noodles and it was served HOT instead of chilled as tsukemen is supposed to be.  I also saw a piece of moldy cabbage in my tsukemen which I put on my separate plate and I brought it up to the server just to let the kitchen know so they can check the rest of their cabbage. The server picked up the moldy piece of cabbage with his fingers from my plate and took it to the kitchen. No sorry, no thank you, just seemed like I bothered him. Wasn't looking for a comp, just wanted to give them a heads up."

        "Kayhan E.": "I've been hearing about this place for a while, but my s/o has been avoiding it because it's near the Tenderloin. I eventually convinced her to go and it did not disappoint. Even on a weekday, you still have wait in line. The place opens at 5 and we got there around 5:15, but we still had to wait like 20 minutes. There's very limited seating and people start lining up even before they open.  We got the corn wings, Enoki Chips, G.K.O, and the Tori Paitan, and the A5 wagyu nigiri. The corn wings and GKO were not my favorites personally, the Enoki was delicious. The A5 wagyu nigiri tastes exactly how you think it'd taste. Wagyu on rice. A little underwhelming, but we ordered it since it was \"limited\". The Tori Paitan was probably the best ramen I've had in SF so far. I will definitely be going back to try their other ramens."

        "Stephanie Y.": "My family (including my 99-year-old Grandpa) and I went to the RH Palm Court the other week for my celebratory birthday lunch. Like the RH restaurant in Yountville, the design and ambiance of the restaurant are beautiful and perhaps even a little bit swanky. The high ceilings and the skylight windows make the space feel bright, open, and high-end.  Located at the historic Bethlehem Steel Building, the Palm Court restaurant is inside one of RH's furniture showrooms. So be sure to come early or stay after your reservation to explore the store and check out the great views from the rooftop deck.  The lunch menu isn't expansive, but the food is well-executed and delicious. We decided to do family style and for a party of 5, we ordered 2 Classic Caesars, the Wagyu Ribeye, a half Rotisserie Chicken, the whole Branzino, the maitake mushroom, a side of truffle fries, and all the desserts (Caramelized Banana Split, Butterscotch Brle, and Birthday Cake). We left lunch feeling full but not stuffed. The Classic Caesar, Wagyu Ribeye, and truffle fries were the table favorites. My mom called the Caesar salad the best she has had in years, the Wagyu Ribeye which has a touch of caramelized brown sugar on top melted in our mouths, and the fries were nice and crispy with just the right amount of truffle flavor. The rotisserie chicken was our least favorite, and although the meat was juicy, the dish wasn't anything special, and I would probably skip it on a future visit. The birthday cake had good flavor but was a little too dense for me, and the butterscotch brle was too sweet. I had just a small bite of the banana split (I hate bananas...), but my mom and husband agreed that it was a good banana and the best of the three desserts. The Palm Court at RH is a great place to have brunch/lunch or for celebrations with friends and family. Good service, good food, good ambiance, what's not to love?"

        "Gene D.": "What an impressive building, both outside and inside! Who would have thought this was once the office of a ship building company. Kudos to RH for seeing a \"diamond in the rough\". In order to get the full experience, arrive at least 45 mins before your reservation. Order a glass of wine/champagne or a beer at the restaurant, then take the elevator to the roof. Enjoy the view of the harbor, etc. whilst relaxing in one of the many seating areas with a fire pit. Go down and enjoy the 2 wings on the each of the remaining floors to see the furnishings. Feel free to relax and chat on the many couches/chairs whilst enjoying your beverage. Forget about wondering how much each piece cost; you're here for the ambience and food. And oh, do not forget to head back to the restaurant when your reservation time has come up. Noah (sp?) and the rest of the staff were friendly, welcoming, and dedicated to providing the best service. Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves and the items we ordered. We went on a Friday during the Lenten season, so we were not able to partake of the wagyu ribeye or chicken. I suggest the following in order to gain a 5-star rating: 1) Service - Do offer the complimentary bread with salted butter when offering water. We discovered the bread was available when we saw some being brought to another table. It would have great with the burrata; it was still good with our entrees. 2) Food - Do switch back to standard cut fries instead of shoestring/matchstick fries. What we had reminded us of Potato Stix sprinkled with Truffle seasoning. 3) Dessert - Do rethink the 3 offerings available. The Banana Split sounded too boring to order. The Butterscotch Brulee was overly sweet and barely edible. The 4 of us powered through it because it cost $16! The SusieCakes American Birthday Cake was just ok. You offered a sprinkle option? Huh?"

So good! 4/5 - Caramelized banana split - similar caramelized sugar that was on the brle, but also very tasty! The decor and vibe is just very cool.

I would actually come back to try the other items or visit another location to see how they compare. Our table shared everything family style and here's what we enjoyed -- 1. The Belgian waffle This was our tables favorite lol if there's anything I would recommend to get, it would be this. Yes, the waffles.  2. Burrata OR branzino So the reason I had to dock a star was because the burrata was delicious, but it definitely needed some bread! We asked for it and they kindly brought it to us, but why wasn't it offered already? The branzino was also really good! Flavorful, easy to eat, and some people at our table were fighting for the eyeball HAHA both good options! 3. truffle fries I'm not a truffle girly so this wasn't my favorite, but it was still good to share.  4. Maitake Mushroom Collectively we decided this was just not good at all lol. Not much flavor to it, needed salt and just.. something else. Skip.  We also ordered some Bellini's and those were actually p good.  Service was alriiiight. Our main server wasn't as friendly as others. One girl was SO SWEET and offered to help us take pictures LOL. Later on after our meal, I wanted to surprise our birthday girl with a cake and she went ahead and told our server for me bc she was no where to be found.

        "Ed U.": "Gee, I remember when I used to go to Restoration Hardware for drawer pulls. What happened? It's now called RH like it was the definition of cool. They got fancy and upscale, and now they've added fine dining to their line of services. They've been doing it for several years, but I guess I fell out of their target demographic because none of this was on my limited IKEA-level radar. However, I was reading a friend's Facebook post, and he was describing a sweet dining experience with his aged mom at this place. I thought it would be nice to take Jamie W. here to celebrate the sunshine after all those atmospheric rivers. We had both seen the huge white classical building at the corner of Illinois and 20th where it appears the surrounding Pier 70 rehabilitation has stalled. A doorman greeted us as we entered the majestic foyer. The retail part of the store consisted of staged rooms, very plush with huge artistic installations that's probably the norm for living rooms in Hillsborough and Atherton. There wasn't a price tag in sight because presumably you have to work with their interior decorators to choose the right neutral tones for your manse. The Palm Court is in the middle of the building and immediately evoked the Palace Hotel's Garden Court and The Rotunda at Neiman Marcus. It didn't feel as menopausal, but there was a slight ladies-who-lunch vibe to the ambiance. The prices in the menu definitely shouted special occasion, but the dishes described came across as surprisingly simple and straightforward. We started with an appropriate libation, a couple of refreshing $16 RH Bellinis made with Prosecco and peach pure (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3HbuOs8&s=9bcf708f46d207619547565dae00120fef205b0ca6bafb5f50e85bff3e2b3e93\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3HbuOs8</a>). Our shared appetizer was the $24 Fresh Burrata lusciously presented with a combination of heirloom and cherry tomatoes mixed with rustic pesto (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3XCBo1Z&s=a3e6cee8836010aa1b47dfc4d5ea532a74985c39cdc37c91c45dcdb25b182b6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3XCBo1Z</a>). Tasted luscious, too. We decided the mains were a bit pricey for our proletarian tastes. Instead Jamie went for the $32 Rotisserie Chicken Salad which was a simple presentation of an organic Jidori chicken sitting on a bed of butter lettuce drizzled with olive oil, lemon, and chives (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3XF4DRE&s=dfc254d95e5ac30aaded86d5310ea3215aea450efa7b344948edf0b79cd9cce1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3XF4DRE</a>). Delicious and the chicken was roasted perfectly. I ordered the $56 Wagyu Ribeye Sandwich, so melty tender and layered with caramelized onion and aioli in a charred ciabatta roll on a wooden board with a bit of arugula (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3ZV3K98&s=24ebd9605ef4f51401e8d5bfaebe7215708f27e0237e22dee4b3d9b02c34d7c2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3ZV3K98</a>). Based on a Japanese program we just saw on NHK World, we shared a side dish, the $16 Coal Roasted Sweet Potatoes, creamy tasty with honey brown butter, creme fraiche, and chives (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3j5ByQl&s=67d4a8d87052f86e24349ece168cb3678d2782d3aa382ba94858fb7dcdbb5a4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3j5ByQl</a>). Thank goodness there were two because negotiation would've been difficult. They were sweet enough to be dessert, but of course, that didn't prevent us from ordering a couple. Jamie ordered the $20 Caramelized Banana Split. It was the fanciest version that Dairy Queen never made with three scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, caramel sauce, and brled banana halves (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3WFdSAb&s=18f78fc8ba3954af04be089ccbadc88b90936a3be2c5ebc2fc8085c76268935f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3WFdSAb</a>). I had the $16 Butterscotch Brle which was described with the phrase \"No Words\" (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3j1gPgK&s=532bf143c153416f00b16be7094b659248bb668e234d8a5c57822eeb09f2bfb0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3j1gPgK</a>).

We felt like royalty!  A hostess met us on the other side of the doors, guided us through the majestic lobby, down the cathedral corridor, to the palatial Palm Court...the first sight inside the restaurant was breathtaking!  Gorgeous inverted pyramid glass chandeliers, four tall elegant date palms, a center court water-fountain, marbled floors and lovely furnishings. It wowed us! We couldn't wait to be seated! (By the way, reservations are absolutely needed!) Menu matched the ambiance--not an overcrowded selection. Menu had thoughtful simplicity--elegant food prepared to perfection with a beautiful presentation. We ordered: BEET CARPACCIO - an circular array of thinly sliced sunset colored beets, drizzled with cider vinaigrette, dollop of goat cheese hidden under frise. Such a pretty dish! Not just pretty, this was absolutely delicious as well! Fresh, delicate sweetness, light citrus tartness, a fresh lift of frise, finished with creamy tang of goat cheese! Would order this again! CAULIFLOWER STEAK - wood roasted, Mediterranean herbs and olive oil. This was delicious too. I liked the char flavor with hint of lemon given to this large slice of cauliflower roasted to perfection! Served with side of arugula salad. ROTISSERIE CHICKEN - half bird, freshly carved, natural au jus, rosemary & garlic. Chicken was very tender. I enjoyed dipping pieces of meat into the au jus. Lightly seasoned, not overpowering. Served with side of arugula salad. TRUFFLE FRIES - this was a fun side to compliment our entrees. Thin crispy strings of potatoes. Black Truffles, garlic, dusted with Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. It came with a mayo aioli for dipping. But we felt it tasted better with good ol' ketchup! The sweetness of the ketchup balanced out the strong truffle infused flavor. These fries were so yummy, we ate them all! Service was on point. Our server tended to us without being intrusive. Also offered to take our pictures, which was nice! After dinner, there are plenty of showrooms throughout the building to continue mingling and lounging! Did I mention this is Restoration Hardware furniture store? If interested, they have sales people who can assist with buying! The furniture here is sophisticated (read: expensive) and yet very inviting and comfortable. Our favorite spot was the rooftop patio: Toasty fire pits, voluminous comfy patio furniture, cool lit walkways--and a fantastic skyline view of the city! We sat here for a while to chat!

With the restaurant being inside an RH establishment, there are so many show rooms with amazing lighting, fully furnished, you can take amazing photos of yourself/party. No I'm not saying this place is \"instagrammable\" but if you want to take that family photo and is embarrassed of how messy your own living room is, use theirs here. Oh yeah we dressed up because it was my sister's birthday, and all the women in the family are her guests. So we figure we do valet parking right up front and it's only $30. I'm in heels and don't feel like walking. You pay through the app I recall so no cash is involved and it's a flat rate (I wasn't prompted to tip oddly). Anyway, we had reservations and after checking in, wander around and do your photo shoot until your table is ready. They weren't on time but its okay we enjoyed hanging out in our fantasy living rooms. This place can be family friendly actually. They had a high chair for my toddler niece and it's the loveliest high chair I've seen in my life! This restaurant is clearly very busy but also very lovely. I can see why the food is priced how they are. We went back in November and since then then prices have increased. Below are the current (1/2023) prices: Here's what our party of 5 (one being a toddler) ordered: RH BELLINI - $16 Prosecco, Peach Pure. A bit of bubbly with some sweet peach juice, this was a lovely drink. I don't know how much it is today, but it was $16. BELGIAN WAFFLE - $22 Rustic Country Style, Butter, Maple Syrup. The price isn't current so it's probably like $30. I really enjoyed this because it was crispy, and actually crispy throughout. Light, airy, crispy inside out. Some may not like that, and although I would prefer it be softer towards the center, I still enjoyed it. Dunk those crispy bites in the warm maple syrup after you've slathered butter over it. Those maple syrup had better been from Vermont or something with that price. I love that both pieces of waffles had a nice large slice of butter on them like something out of a cartoon. GRILLED AVOCADO WITH CAVIAR - $52 15g Imperial Kaluga Caviar by Petrossian, Crme Frache Yeah, okay this was pretty amazing. Yes it's half an avocado, filled with creame fraiche where the seed hole is, topped with caviar. Would I ever order it again? Nope. Do I feel ridiculous and extra ordering and enjoying this? Yes. Don't tell my mom. TRUFFLE FRIES - $20 Thin & Crispy, Black Truffles, Parmigiano Reggiano They did not mess up on these fries. Sure I didn't really taste the truffle but it sure what a fine catch of crispy yummy fries! I with there was more Parmigiano Reggiano toppings. COAL ROASTED SWEET POTATOES - $20 Honey Brown Butter, Crme Frache, Chives. I dont think I tried this but my mom enjoyed it. She doesn't know how much the grilled avocado was. Shhhh.... FRESH BURRATA - $28 Heirloom & Cherry Tomatoes, Rustic Pesto. I thought it was interesting that this dish did not come with bread...unless this was a keto meal I wasn't aware of. Anyway, relieved to know that amazing bread and butter we requested was complimentary. Whew! Oh right, yeah this Buratta was pretty damn amazing. So simple and so good! I dont even like tomatoes yet these huge chunks were successful! So much flavor! Get it and share it, and ask for bread.  MAITAKE MUSHROOM - $36 Wood Grilled, Crispy Rosemary Potatoes. Great for vegetarians. The mushroom was flavorful, and you get 2 huge chunks of them. Check out the photo you'll see. And the potatoes were great--lots of flavor, crisp on the outside and soft towards the center. Right amount of starch. WAGYU RIBEYE - $125 14 oz Westholme Australian Wagyu, Wood Grilled, Thinly Sliced. Down 't get this. You'd be disappointed like I was. All you get is a board of thinly sliced meat and nothing else, and that just tastes like mediocre steak. I had one slice and didn't care to have more. You're welcome I saved you $125. HEARTH BURGER - $38 Slab of Monterey Jack, Caramelized Onion, Aioli, Charred Ciabatta. I've had the burger before but at a different HR location and remember it being really good. This was weird because the Ciabatta was super hard and over toasted. It was like biting into a brick, and I'm sure the roof of my mouth is scraped up. I thought they made a mistake on my burger but I overheard other customers commenting the same. At least it came it a tiny salad??? Everything else was good, just be on the lookout on what kind of bun it's served on and ask your server how it's prepared. I have to skip the dessert portion because this reviews has exceeded its word limit :( Overall, the appetizers were better than the main course. Everything was either hit or miss, and if you are okay paying for items that are overly priced for a wonderful ambiance and photoshoot, then this place is your jam."

Service--incredible. They considered all my food allergies and offered me some off-menu items so that I would have a great experience. They also seated us before our reservation time without giving us a hard time. It felt like the genuinely cared which is really hard to find nowadays. Food - always inventive and unique.

        "Pia Letecia P.": "I wanted to LOVE this place so bad but I couldn't and walked away disappointed. I heard about this upscale Filipino restaurant in SF and it's always been on my radar to try \"elevated\" Filipino food.  As a Filipino immigrant, I finally had a good excuse to check this place out. I came here after my US citizenship ceremony in the city to celebrate with my family and thought the concept of a high end restaurant serving Filipino flavors would be poetic for such a monumental day in my life but TBH, the flavors lacked anything I could have wanted. In fact, there was no real flavor and everything fell flat. This place is also very pricey for what you get. We tried lots of things on their menu and none were memorable. I don't want to even describe the dishes we tried because there was nothing worth remembering. The pandan drink was good though and that's the only nice thing I could say about their food.  I only give this place 2 stars because the servers were very kind and the ambiance was lovely. I would come here for only a drink or two after getting food elsewhere. For a party size of 5, we paid over $500+ and it was not worth it. I will not be back."

        "Tony P.": "The food is good (4/5), and the atmosphere and service are excellent (5/5). However, this place did not meet my high extremely expectations (especially after seeing their promotional videos), and I actually had a better dining experience at Boudin (not a Filipino restaurant, just another restaurant in the same neighborhood) for less than half the price of Abaca. I don't regret dining here, but I probably would not come back. I can tell that the staff and really loves their cuisine, and I admire the vision of the head chef for wanting to prove that Filipino cuisine can be upscale. I can tell that they really want to put a lot of love into this place, and I truly hope that they do well. However, maybe this just isn't my kind of place. For anyone who loves Filipino food, I believe that they would enjoy their meal. But would it be good value for the money? If you are willing to pay more money for Filipino food and excellent presentation and service, then go for it! Ultimately, in my humble opinion, there are better-tasting foods for much less money."

I thought the other dishes were ok. I was sadly disappointed on the Buko pie. I really wanted to like this dessert but the coconut was so hard. Maybe I should have asked for them to warm it up(?)  Our server was very sweet and helpful. I do want to come back for dinner as the menu looks good!"

        "Mimi L.": "I've never had Filipino food my entire life until this restaurant and bar. And it's a fancy one at that, isn't that kinda cool! It's a very small restaurant inside Kimpton Alton hotel. It serves breakfast, weekend brunch and dinner. No lunch and Sunday dinners. So it was inconvenient for us staying at the hotel for two weeks. I had to go out to get lunch daily.  I wasn't familiar with Filipino food at all so it took me a while to learn the items on the menu. To my surprise everything was so light and I thought Filipino foods were greasy? We really liked the skewers, rice porridge and chicken rice noodles, the desserts were amazing as well. The food portions were very small for the prices so I had to order a bunch even just for myself.  We ate at the bar everyday and the bartenders were fantastic all the time. The N/A drinks were good but a bit pricey. The cocktails were amazingly made and I liked all of them. The food, drinks and services were consistently great. I was very impressed!  This is a great place to have Filipino food and it's definitely on the healthy side!  Ps. 20% service charge plus 4% health SF surcharge, so it's a lot of tips added together!"

        "James H.": "4/5 excellent Filipino fusion. The food manages to be homey and high end. Service is good, the bar tenders are particularly friendly (they even let us try a sip of a cocktail out of the dregs remaining from their shaker).  Food was pricey but great. We had the tocino plate and savory ensaymada French toast. We also shared the lumpia and had a bibinka pastry. We also had an ube rum cocktail and an amazing coffee liqueur cocktail with parmasean foam.  Tocino 4/5 this was the most simple and traditional dish we had. Nothing like fried eggs, garlic rice, and pork! Really good combo of savory and sweet and very hearty and healthy portion.  Savory ensaymada 3/5 this dish sounded better than it was executed but was still devious. Buttery brioche French toast with lemon shrimp and a savory hollandaise and some kind of fish roe. It ended up being too decadent and rich and the brioche couldn't stand up to the sauce and lemon juice.  Lumpia (4/5) excellent lumpia. It think pork and shrimp? Good portion and I liked the apple ketchup sub for the traditional banana ketchup.  Ube rum cocktail 3/5 looked pretty but very strong and hard to really taste the ube.  Parmesan coffee cocktail 5/5. I wish I remembered the name of this one. One of the better and prettier cocktails I've had in a while.  Ambiance was cool. The restaurant itself was definitely instagramable but felt really random as part of the hotel lobby.  Bibinka (4/5! Loved the idea of serving this with toasted Brie cheese. Sweet and savory and thereby super Filipino!"

        "Ryna D.": "Possibly the hottest modern Filipino restaurant right now! And for good reason! This is modern Filipino cuisine at its best. Where anyone who knows traditional Filipino food will tell you these dishes aren't typical Filipino and yet every single one of them is grounded in authentic Filipino ingredients and flavors. It's the kind of food that remains elusive in Manila. It's elevated but unapologetically Filipino. Ube sourdough and tinapa in the avo toast! Tikoy waffle! Ensaymada as French toast but savory and with oysters! That garlic rice with the tocino and tapa. The Brie atop that bibingka! Everything was so good I'm not even apologizing about the excessive use of exclamation marks. LOL.. With DC's Bad Saint closing last year and NY's Jeepney closing back in 2021, I'm so happy to have Abaca carry the torch forward, so to speak.. (Seattle's Musang and Chicago's Kasama are two places I have yet to visit..) I hope to go back for dinner next time I'm in SFO."

        "Colleen D.": "I was really underwhelmed during our recent visit to Abac. This was partly my fault as I didn't know that they only offered a partial brunch menu rather than their full menu when we went. The food was extremely tasty but what put a damper on the experience was the service. My uncle was having a mimosa with brunch and could've easily ordered more drinks and food but our server rarely checked in on us. I realize that there was a bigger party/table at the time we visited but this shouldn't compromise the experience of other patrons. Overall ambiance was great despite lacking the service department (restaurant is inside Alton Hotel). Might give it another try for a dinner res in the future."

        "Chang L.": "Oh god. Do me a favor and do NOT come here. The food is mediocre and overpriced, and the service is quite bad and they charge you a mandatory 20% tip. The audacity! This is surely the most disappointing restautant experience I've had in SF to date.  The food is quite average and very small portioned. We ordered 6 dishes, and only liked 2 of them - the pork bun and the sisig fried rice. But honestly it's kind of hard to screw those up. The rest of the dishes like chicken satti, pork sausage, crab salad and short rib were downright bad especially considering the price. The crab salad is kind of bland and I can't believe they charge you $30 for a few bites. The short rib was a whopping $70. At that price, you could have gotten really good short rib at Mourad, so you expect them to knock your socks off... but they didn't. In fact the flavor was kind of weird.  Service was bad. There was no one checking on us, switching out our dirty plates or refilling our water. Towards the end they kind of forgot about us and didn't come to us for the check until we flagged them down. For this level of service, we were charged 20% gratuity. We definitely won't be returning."

        "Tim C.": "I came on a Sunday night around 8:30pm and the place was packed. Thankfully, there were just two of us and we were fine with eating at the bar, so we didn't have to wait for a table. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially considering how packed it was. They took time to explain some things on the menu and helped us make a decision on what to order. We decided on the Tea Leaf Salad, Samusa Soup, and Lamb Burmese Curry to split.  My favorite was the Samusa Soup. This is weird for me to say because I usually don't seek out soups on a menu, but my brother - who has been here a few times - recommended the soup, so I thought I'd give it a try. It was delicious! It had a rich depth of flavor with some tangy / sour-ness to it as well as a touch of sweetness that blended excellently together. On top of that, it came with some falafel, samosas, and other fried goodies on the side, which you could dump into the soup and eat together, or just dip if you'd prefer. We dumped the contents in the soup and the crispy texture of the fried foods and cabbage and onions provided the perfect textural contrast. This soup was awesome, and I rarely rave about soups. I also enjoyed the Lamb Burmese Curry - the lamb was slow-cooked to a tender texture, and the curry was not like what you would expect in an Indian curry, but had more of a Chinese hong shao flavor to it. Very good. The Tea Leaf Salad was nice, but came in last for me in terms of ranking the dishes we tried. I appreciated the flavors, although I feel like it could have been a little saltier. The crunch of the nuts and beans were a great addition to provide texture. All in all, it was a great experience for me in trying these unique and delicious flavors of Burmese cuisine."

        "Zachary H.": "Overall, good food and ambience. I really enjoyed their tea leaf salad, it had a ton of great textures and flavors. The combo of nuts and tea leafs really were a constant rollercoaster ride, and aptly fit their description of an explosion in your mouth. The ice cream and Turon was super decadent, but the ice cream was the clear winner of that pairing. The Turon was a bit chewy and didn't seem perfectly made. Overall, service was great as well, would totally go back but there is a long wait for this place, so def keep that in mind!"

Superstar vegetarian noodles - This is a cold noodle dish. Super yummy. Dried fried string beans - One of my favorites! Amazing flavors!"

We ordered the broccoli, the chili lamb spicy and the pumpkin pork stew. The broccoli and the pork stew were fabulous. Well prepared and very tasty. The lamb was well prepared and quite spicy but there was a flavor in there that I was not overly fond of. Not a dish I would order again. Portions were huge. We easily could have shared one salad and one entree. That would have been plenty."

For food, we shared a couple dishes: Garlic Noodles w/ Shrimp - the noodles were SO good, the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Overall a perfectly balanced dish! Pork Belly with Mustard Green - WOW this was also SO good! The port was perfectly tender and flavorful, and the mustard greens were also so flavorful. I will be thinking about this dish for a while. Coconut Rice - we got this as a side for the pork, but omg it was so good even by itself! The rice REALLY had a strong coconut flavor and I was living for it. I absolutely will be ordering this every time I go here. Really an amazing restaurant, and the bar seating is perfect and actually a bit quieter than the main dining area.

Their menu is overwhelming in a good way and has a lot of good stuff. After going through the menu thrice we decided to order the Platha and dip (chicken) and chicken wings for the appetisers. Honestly the Platha and dip was amazing, so creamy and delicious with the perfect balance of all the flavours. The chicken wings were alright nothing great.  For the main course we had the Mango chicken and I was a little hesitant to order this because I didn't know how it will taste. But the Mango chicken was the star dish for our lunch. It was really really good.  I really liked the food here and would love to come back again and try out more things on their menu. Their service was also top notch. The servers were quick and very warm. I would highly recommend trying the Mango chicken which was my favourite dish here."

A huge portion, nicely cooked and not over cooked. The mediocre- the sweet and spicy chicken, which I have had before several times at the Mint Plaza location, where it was mind blowing good. Here it was more like a golf ball of dough with the tiniest chicken cube shoved inside, rather than a crispy breaded chicken basket of heaven. It was weird, truth be told. The yellow bean tofu. Just no.  The side of rice - literally the smallest amount of rice I have ever seen. I guess I need to go back downtown and fight my way through the homeless people in Mint Plaza when I need my Burma Love fix. Not loving the Mission outpost."

The bar staff was very nice and the service was quicker than I thought it would be for it being busy inside.  All of our plates were delicious and I'd recommend getting the platha & dip to start off with. We got chicken curry and they also have a veggie option. The tea leaf salad is one of my faves and the combination of nuts, beans, and garlic is perfection. And then we tried the spicy lamb dish, which I thought was very tasty and not as spicy as it sounds. Each dish was packed with flavor that made them stand out. I can't wait to try more on their menu."

The waiters were attentive, and periodically checked in on my table. Now, for the bad part. The only non-alcoholic options they had for beverages were tap water and lemonade. I stuck with water, even though I wanted a coke which was listed on the menu. I had questions about my menu, asking simple questions if some of the courses were meant for sharing, or individually. She could not quite give me the answer I wanted, saying figuratively that any dish could be shared. Unfortunately this resulted in ordering too much for food for a party of two. I the flat bread appetizer was okay, it was a bit too sweet; would've been perfected if the cheese was distributed more evenly. The courses come, and they were large. Not what I was hoping for. I ordered a lamb shank, with almonds and an apricot like sauce. It had good presentation, but there was barely any meat. It mostly bone and gristle. The almonds were more filling that accompanied it. Being it was one of more pricier options on the menu I expected more. My partner's dish was slightly better, but once again, not knowing how much food we ordered, it was too much. I did not feeling a well a few hours later. It went right through my stomach. This place was a miss for me."

Interior is simply breathtaking- I spent quite some time studying the intricacies of various mosaics scattered throughout the restaurant as well as beautifully painted murals hidden in wall arches. It's obvious that a lot of love and attention were poured into this space.  Food was simply delicious. I got to try labneh dip with the homemade bread, cauliflower appetizer and tenderly sweet Mrouzia the lamb shank which was my favorite. What an experience I must say! My mouth was constantly bursting with rich flavors- I surely enjoyed and savored every single bite, every texture and every spice.  Wine selection is unique and quite interesting- I got to try a glass of Georgian red and was very pleasantly surprised by how refined and balanced it was.  Service was attentive and solid, lovely ladies were a pleasure to chat with.  It got pretty busy around 7 pm- reservations are recommended (they are on Resy I believe). Will come back soon!"

        "Nini C.": "From the owners of Khamsa, the best Moroccan restaurant in the city. However, I think L'mida is my new favorite. While Khamsa mostly focuses on tagjnes, L'mida has a wood fire oven in which they make their flatbreads. What is different is that they also have a grill and they make great meats. They also have tagines but we didn't get it on our first visit as we've had their tagines (delicious and authentic) at Khamsa many times in the past. We ordered the Zaarda which has great portions of different cuts of meat with bread. We also got the zaatar flat bread and some of the dips. The whole meal was good portion, affordable, and most of all delicious.  One of the better meals we've had in awhile.  We just went to Saffys in LA (cult favorite place) and got their large meat dish there and dare I say, I would say L'mida's Zaarda is much better than Saffys' skewer dish.  It's absurd as most of the 1 star reviews are \"locals\" complaining about 20% automatic tip. How much do these \"locals\" tip? They talk about this place not being able to \"cut it\" in the marina. Food in the marina isn't good at all. Most exist just because the marina is a destination and there's not many places to choose from. I would argue L'mida is probably one of the best on Chestnut.  It's weird/funny how this place has a really high rating on Google review but yelpies always have something to yelp about. \"OMIGOSH waiter didn't say bye. 1 star.\" Not joking, there's actually one review in here that is 1 star as she was \"not acknowledged.\" The \"scene\" on a Friday night was a bit not my cup of mint tea though. Groups of bachelorette party types and frat bros, drinking and chatting. They don't pressure people to leave so I can see it causing back up on the wait times, even if someone has a reservation especially for a later seating.  The night we went, they were short staffed by 2 people. 1 person called in sick and 1 person didn't show up. It's tough running a small business in the city with rampant inflation. They've had a dozen of people turnover by the time we went and it was only a month in. It's a small business, have some compassion yelpies. Actually maybe it's a good thing that the insufferable yelpies don't show up, to what's one of my new favorite restaurants in the city. The only constructive feedback is that the layout is a bit odd and it's hard for the waitstaff to traverse the restaurant and it feels cramped for the tables in the middle of the restaurant.  Can't wait to return on a school night."

        "Rio C.": "TLDR: What was supposed to be a special occasion fell incredibly flat. Ambiance: The best part of my visit to L'Mida was the pleasant ambiance. Everything was impeccably clean, well lit with mood lighting (shout out the cute usb-c charged lamps on every table), perfect volume of the music, nice temperature, and the lotion in the bathrooms was a nice touch. The paintings on the walls and the addition of lotion in the bathrooms was a pleasant surprise.  Presentation: The presentation was on par with the rating of the restaurant from prior research before dining. Nothing super fancy, but met expectations. The one knock would be that the fromage flatbread was nothing close to the pictures from online being that it was not raised in the slightest. Taste: I was so let down by the taste of the food. We ordered the fromage flatbread, couscous, and beef tagine. The underlying theme of every dish was vaguely sweet, unseasoned, unspiced, unbalanced, and below room temp. Not a hint of salt or depth of flavor. The beef tagine was really tough and one of the pieces had no meat and instead was hard unrendered fat connected to a bone. The texture of the lamb in the couscous was probably the best part of the meal with how tender it was, but missed in every other category. The raisins were also quite plump. The flatbread was tortilla thin without any chew and was overpowered by the balsamic.  Service: The host and waitstaff were welcoming and checked in on us the appropriate amount. Weirdly, the waitstaff tried to take dishes from us and the table next to us that we were both actively eating out of, which has never happened to me. Price/Value: I did enjoy that the portion sizes were pretty generous for a nice restaurant, but with how poorly the food was executed it wasn't worth it. The potential is absolutely there with adjustments for this to be a gem. I am not sure if it was just an off night, but I have no plans on going again."

The must gets: - Brazilian cheesy buns (small portion but so delicious with the side sauces) - Citrus and Ginger Glazed Sweet Potatoes - these are so flavorful and the texture is incredible. - Fried chicken - As everyone has said in the reviews, the star of the show.  And it can all be made gluten free and you won't even notice!  Don't sleep on the key lime pie either... the raspberry sauce is insane!"

        "Victoria R.": "So delicious, albeit a little pricey! The ambiance here is super cozy and warm, perfect for this homestyle cooking.  We ordered the Gumbo, the Fried Chicken, and the spiced date cake:  - The Fried Chicken was the star of the night, it was cooked perfectly, and the accompanying cornbread was so good and, of course, came with some honey!  - The Gumbo was good. It is vegetarian, which is great, but it doesn't taste like authentic Gumbo, so if that is what you are craving, it may not be the best choice. Definitely a little spicey, but I liked the kick it had.  - When I said the fried Chicken was the star of the night, I lied. The spiced date cake alone will make me return to Firefly, the toffee sauce that tops the moist cake is absolutely to die for, and the vanilla ice cream is a perfect balancing addition."

        "Sonia N.": "Our friend group chose Firefly for our holiday get-together. For 6 people with different dietary needs, this place seemed to have something for everyone! And (spoiler alert!) we were not disappointed. Apparently, between the chef and their family, there are people with gluten intolerance (celiac) and others who are vegan. As such, much of the menu is gluten-free, and there are several vegan options or vegan-modifiable dishes. So thoughtful!  Another exciting aspect of the menu was the drink list, which included a number of curated beers, seltzers, and wines (including non-alcoholic ones - I got a sparkling reisling).  Note that the service here was also top-notch - friendly, informative, and accommodating.  For my meal, I stuck with appetizers so as to try more things. I got the kale salad (modified with vegan feta instead of Gorgonzola), daikon radish cakes (one of the most highly rated dishes here - for good reason!), and the Hanukkah latkes (subbed vegan sour cream). My husband got the seed bread and the vegan gumbo. Everything was beyond delicious. Unfortunately, my items were so good that husband kept sneaking more tastes of them! I did get a couple bites of the gumbo, which was rich and full of a variety of textures - I loved the fried mushrooms on top! He also added some of the hot sauce that was provided, which added a welcome kick.  The rest of the table ordered fried chicken and buttermilk biscuits (huge hit) and a Brazilian seafood stew. Everything was devoured. We ended the meal on a sweet note with the banana cake (moist, delicious, and perfectly spiced with ginger). Our friends got the pumpkin cheesecake. Personally I had to be rolled out of my seat, but it was well worth it.  We did have an outdoor table, but the heater was blazing and the food did not get overly cold despite a frigid night. Some reviews state that the inside is cramped, so I was expecting something unpleasant, but it was soooo cute and I can't wait to be back to experience the indoor ambiance. Finally, I want to note the tiny detail in the bathroom that made me so happy - free menstrual products. While I didn't require them, it was such a kind feature that truly exemplifies the ethos of this restaurant.  Thank you, Firefly for a lovely evening!"

Creative non-alcoholic beverage options in addition to a solid wine list. Our server and all the staff we interacted with were thorough, responsive, and friendly. I had the seeded bread with spread, turnip radish cakes, and the olive oil cake -- can't believe I finished all of it but the food was too good to stop eating. It's great to go out for dinner somewhere nice that is warm and not at all pretentious or overly sleek--that's few and far between in SF these days. Thanks Firefly for a great evening!"

The restaurant itself is off the beaten path from the hustle and bustle of upper 24th Street. It's super cozy in there. I liked the feel.  They have a good menu with a variety of items. We started the meal with a variety of appetizers and they were all yummy. We had the seed bread, brussel sprouts, and sweet potatoes. For the main course I had the fried chicken. It was excellent. It came with mashed potatoes and a biscuit. Super good. They have a decent wine list too. Had a nice glass of wine which was a red blend. It had been a while since we had some dessert while out for dinner and we went for the brownie sundae. It was very yummy, I highly recommend it. Service was decent, food was very good, and prices weren't too crazy. I will be back again at some point!"

(It's the week before Christmas and the middle of Hanukkah, so that may have worked in our favor). We started with the brussels sprouts with truffle oil (amazing!).  I ordered two appetizers for my entree- latkes and butternut squash with whipped feta, quinoa tabbouleh and pumpkin seeds. SO DELICIOUS!! and it made me feel less guilty about the way I'll eating the rest of the holiday week. We also got the fried chicken, which comes with slaw, mashed potatoes and a biscuit. Clean plates all around (they even bring honey and butter for the biscuit). This is a Firefly classic and deservedly so.  The mac and cheese was piping hot and got devoured slightly more slowly than everything else only due to temperature. The decor is sort of Wind in the Willows, with an actual giant firefly above the door, low lights, lots of wood, very cozy."

        "Annie L.": "I found Firefly on a list of romantic restaurants for date night in the city. It's in a residential neighborhood of Noe Valley. A small quaint restaurant serving American. The interior has many small tables for two, bar seating and the soft glow of their faux candle in a jar. We had reservations at 6pm. We had our vaccinations card checked and was seated in a small table across from the bar.  The portions here are a good size and shareable. We ordered the fried chicken (must try!) and crusted salmon with asparagus and quinoa. Both dishes were delicious. The fried chicken was fried perfectly and comes with coleslaw, mashed potatoes and biscuit. There was a hot dipping sauce for the fried chicken if you like a spicy kick. They also served butter and honey for the biscuit. The crusted salmon was soft, fresh and asked for more on the well done side. Usually I get stuffed after my entree but not here. I still had room for dessert! The sticky coffee date cake with poached apples and almond was a nice end to our dinner. The cake wasn't too sweet. All the food here gave me the impression that it is well cooked, healthy and sustainable.  Service was also quick and prompt. There were two cooks with many orders to fulfill but the wait was not long at all. I also loved the semi dark atmosphere and the art on the wall esp the ballerina girl. Definitely a good spot for dinner or date night with that special someone :)"

We ordered some small bites and a bottle of wine over $100 after having a lovely discussion with the waiter. Maybe 10 minutes after all of our food arrived at our table and us each having only a few sips of our wine, a woman (not the waiter) gave us our check. There were plenty of open tables and nobody was waiting at the door to be seated for the entire duration of our meal. She then proceeded to return to our table every 5-10 minutes for the next hour asking if we were done for each plate of tapas we had ordered even though it was clear we were not finished. Everything other than this woman was lovely but it did unfortunately taint me and my friends' experiences here."

Inside it's dark and could get a little loud at times but we didn't have trouble hearing each other. We had all eaten dinner and were just looking for a little snack so we ordered two items to share.  Crispy potatoes - we ate these up so fast. as the name suggests, they were very crispy. The sauce it came with paired so well too!  Labneh - a thick yogurt sauce topped with some oil and seasoning and served with pita bread. something about this pita bread was so delicious and it smelled so good and bready! I think anyone would love this Domain Christophe blend - I don't have a refined palette for wind but as far as I could tell this was a nice crisp glass of white wine :) Staff was all friendly and I'd definitely return!"

I couldn't really tell it was a rice ball, but it was good. 3/5 - Calamari - just okay, I didn't like the sauce that came with it 3/5 - Margherita - pretty basic and middle of the road 2/5 - Napoletana - too salty but I guess that's what this kind of pizza should taste like. One person in our table loved it 4/5 - Mortadella - probably my favorite pizza out of the three. Although the second slice didn't taste as good as the first slice.

The host asked others ahead of us if they had a reservation but he didn't ask us. He gave us the option of a table in the back or outside under a heat lamp. We chose outside but the table he brought us to was next to an unlit heat lamp. We soon chose to move inside but the available table was next to an unused door that still allowed a draft. Took a long time for us to even get water at the table. Asked for lemon with sparking water but didn't receive any. Asked if 5 onion soup was prepared similarly to french onion and was told yes. In actuality, soup was pureed with chunks of onion, in a non-vegetarian stock. Not what was expected but companion said it was good. We both ordered the special fettucine with cauliflower and prosecco sauce. Companion asked for cheese but host told her to try it first then let him know. Thankfully, the busboy arrived immediately with cheese. Fettucine was tasty but rich. Neither of us finished our serving but both took it to-go. Extensive wine list but no full bar. Dessert menu was tempting but by that time, we were ready to go. Large outdoor space with some heat lamps and canopy. Overall, food was decent but atmosphere and service were sub-par. Very loud crashes from the kitchen, a wine fridge with very annoying lights that blinded my companion and distracted me with window glare every time it was opened (probably 5-6 times in 90 minutes), very little attention from the host/waiter and single busboy, cold at both tables.

        "Amy S.": "We stumbled upon this restaurant while we were walking around Noe Valley, and decided to check it out after seeing it previously had Michelin designation. Overall the pasta was really bland and we left feeling disappointed by the food, especially at this price point. We came on a Sunday around 6pm without a reservation and were seated immediately. FOOD Impepata - This was ok. The mussel meat itself didn't have much flavor and tasted kind of chalky. Tonnarelli - This is the pasta we were most excited for, but it was severely under-seasoned. Somehow despite being a squid ink pasta there was virtually no seafood flavor, and the calamari just tasted watery and rubbery. Brasato - This was probably the best of the items we ordered, but still pretty under-seasoned. The braised beef short rib was cooked really well, but I don't think it was simmered long enough because none of the flavor had seeped into the meat. Tiramisu - My favorite part of tiramisu is the coffee + rum flavor of the cake, which was missing in this one. Tasted just like a regular sponge cake with mascarpone and some sweet, wet layers.  Overall, I think the food was 80% there but missing salt/acid to truly bring out the flavors of each dish."

        "Z M.": "Dined in with the family (4 of us). We had the garlic bread and the beet insalata as starters, then the ravioli, rigatoni, and pollo as main course followed by dessert. The food was quite excellent - seriously: everything we had was superb. The desserts, especially, were delicate and not too heavy, which is not always the case at Italian restaurants. The service appropriately attentive and very friendly. I very highly recommend Bacco and will definitely be coming back on subsequent trips to SF."

The waitress was very nice and brought things out quickly. I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar salad which was very good but towards the end of finishing it, I found a bug in the lettuce which grossed me out. I was bummed because the salad was so good but that completely turned me off once I found that bug in there. Everyone else loved their meals and had no incidents with there's."

I have been thinking of this meal for the past 3 months, it was that good. I missed it but apparently Marc Cuban was also eating dinner there at a table near us. We sat outside on their darling covered patio on a warm April night in the City. The ambiance was perfect for a ladies night out, I loved the massive dogwood branch floral arrangement inside. I think we tried one of everything on the menu and had a couple bottles of wine."

        "Paria A.": "This restaurant has quickly made its way to the top of my list for go-to Italian food in the city! I ate here on a whim when my other dinner plans fell through and it was a serendipitous find.  I started the meal with their house salad. It was bright and fresh. The serving size was very generous. Next came the main dishes. I ordered the gnocchi and my husband ordered the ravioli. Both are handmade in house. The ravioli was delicious -- the browned butter and sage added complexity to a classic dish. Very solid choice. My favorite item was the gnocchi, hands down. It is heavenly. Every bite is like eating a tiny, fully pillow. This is the best gnocchi I've ever tasted. And the sauce on top? Perfection.  Bacco has plenty of seating indoor and outdoor, so wait time, if any, is minimal. It's a great place to go with a group or intimate date night. Prices are incredibly reasonable. Staff was very attentive and friendly. I will be back soon!"

I ordered their Ox Tail soup. They gave me three gigantic ox tail's with noodles and rice. The soup was a bit bland. The ox tail wasn't as soft as I'd like, it didn't full off the bone and was difficult to eat.  Service was great! Love the interior of the resturant. It was wood themed.

All the food comes out prompt and hot so you know you can trust this spot for a quick lunch stop. We got the grilled chicken, japchae, and pork dishes for lunch. The chicken was an unexpected star of the meal, well seasoned and sooo juicy! The beef japchae was chewy and flavorful although I did wish there weee more vegetables to the dish. We especially love how the lunch special comes with a tofu stew, which is soothing and full of tofu.  Love the sweet rice dessert served at the end of the meal. It's refreshing and nice way to wind down from a filling lunch! Will be back for more good eats :)"

Food didn't take forever and a day to come out. The items we ordered were easily top notch, and priced appropriately if not low.  Seasoned seafood (grill item): 100/10 (chock full of seafood and flavor) Rice cake soup: 10/10 ($11.50 - who is complaining?) Steamed egg: 10/10 (I think this dish gave me +1500HP) Came through on a late Saturday afternoon with no wait. Would eat here weekly if I could. haesanmul-gui"

        "Mei Fu L.": "Called in an order to go almost as soon as they opened. There were already people piling in on a weekday afternoon. Inside has a good amount of tables, but im sure it gets crowded fast. We ordered rice cake and meat dumpling soup, galbi and bibimbap lunch specials. They gave lots of different banchan and tofu soup with the lunch specials. The galbi was tender and so tasty. The bibimbap was already mixed and the spicy sauce they gave really complemented the dish. We tried the rice cake and dumpling soup as it's something we dont usually see on menus. The soup was really hearty and perfect for the cold afternoon. Their lunch specials are definitely worth the price. I think regular prices for some items are kinda expensive, but worth for the quality of food and all the extra sides they give. Highly recommend this restaurant."

I also really liked the variety of banchan. It seems a little short staffed so it might take a second to get a hold of staff but they're generally kind and aware of what's happening. A good place for chatting with a friend but also definitely geared toward groups (the tables are all 4+ kinda deal)"

        "David L.": "Good traditional Korean food with tons of different banchan, side dishes. I got the galbitang and thought it was one of the better galbitangs that I've had at a restaurant. This place was highly rated and I even had to wait almost 45 minutes to get in so definitely a popular spot!  Food The galbitang here was really good. Usually restaurants will skimp on how much galbi, or meat, that they give you but this place was different. Tons of meat to my surprise and it was nice and tender. Soup was a little bit salty though for me. I also got the seafood pancake because that is one of my favorite staples to get at any Korean restaurant. It was disappointing, especially for the amount that it costs. The pancake was lots of batter and not much vegetables or seafood. It wasn't crispy either. But it was not that oily, which is good. The banchan was really good and there was tons of variety. They also give you a steamed egg as service, and it was good.  Atmosphere Pretty busy for a Saturday night and I had to wait almost 45 minutes to get seated. Definitely oriented for groups since they don't have seating for 1-2 people. I dined alone and sat at a 4 person table (I dined as fast as I could). Noise level was pretty high with all these people and grilling kbbq going on. Casual atmosphere and dress would be fine here.  Pricing Very expensive Korean food compared to what I'm used to in Seattle. The seafood pancake was $22 and didn't have much seafood either. The kbbq set also pretty pricey in my opinion, but I did not get it. Price could be normal for San Francisco though and food quality was there.  Service Service was okay. Only times they came by my table was to take my order, bring food, and take my money. I had to flag down someone to ask for refills on banchan but they would take the dish and then never came back with it. They were very busy though so I don't fault them too much for it.  Other No parking/very little parking in a pretty residential area. Be prepared to wait if you have a large party. The food was good overall and so I give it 4 stars."

        "Isabel L.": "Finally found my favorite Korean restaurant in the city! We got here around 6 pm on Saturday and the wait was already around 30 minutes. (Tip: get here early, I saw tons of people waiting outside at 7 pm.) The interior is very homey and there's small enclosed booths along the outskirts of the restaurant.  They gave us a super generous amount of banchan- 9 small dishes! We got the spicy gal bi Jim which came with rice cake, potato, and carrot. The meat was deliciously tender and I found the dish to be less greasy than at daehoe (probably thanks to the cheese). We also got the kimchi ji gae which was so comforting and had a good amount of pork, tofu, and kimchi. Lastly, we got the rice cakes which was the one unimpressive dish as it was just rice cake and sauce, but for $17.50.  The prices here seem higher than other Korean restaurants (eg $21 for kimchi jigae) but I think it's well worth it due to the quality of the food + plentiful ban Chan and complementary steamed egg and rice dessert drink (this was the perfect end to a great meal and I wish I knew how to make it!)  I have no doubt I'll be back here again soon!"

        "Claudine R.": "I came here with a friend on a Wednesday for dinner. I think we got lucky with not making a reservation and getting sat right away at 6pm. So, I'm from Orange County and my take is biased from someone who grew up on kbbq and had a plethora of options in OC. I'm used to all you can eat kbbq, yes I know this isn't all you can eat but I think the meats were not up to par with even cheaper spots that are all you can eat kbbq. I also think this spot was way over priced, its $33-$45 for each meat. We order brisket and ribeye. We were comfortably full between 2 girls but for paying over $100, it just wasn't a good bang for your buck. I would hope that with paying those prices they would offer more meat. I don't think I would come back. I'd want to try another spot."

Just by the look of the inside of the restaurant as soon as I walked in, I knew I was in for a pretty authentic experience. We ordered the soondubu and the spicy oxtail soup, both were super delicious and flavorful. The soondubu was the right amount of spicy and had a good balance of tofu vs other ingredients. The beef inside was super tender too which exceeded my expectations! It did not come with an egg though cause I think most tofu soup comes with egg. However, I think I still chose to gave this place five stars because the banchan they serve is super good, plus they serve a whole steamed egg with every Table!  Overall great eating experience and reasonable price and good portion. I think I'd come back again if I were every craving Korean food!"

The sun was just getting ready to set so the vibe in there was glowy.  It was very busy and it took a while for our bartender to take our order. Unfortunately he also took the order of the guy next to us who got there after us first but I guess that's ok. He we got a bottle of sparkling rose and the bumble bee. The cocktail was good - I love the hint of herb they used. We also got fries and devils egg. The aoli that came w the fries was delicious. The devil eggs were ok. I didn't like that they pickled the egg the filling was also a bit too much.  If you're in the area and want drink def try this place out."

It was pretty much dark by the time we sat down, but imagine how lovely it'd be looking out at sunset! I'm not a big beer person, but I ordered a Radler which is beer with lemon soda. It was pretty good! I would have liked a little more carbonation and lemon flavor though. Maybe a squeeze of a lemon wedge on top. I tried a bit of everything we ordered and the chicken schnitzel sandwich was hands down my favorite!! Soft bun, crispy chicken, a little tangy and fresh - it's everything a good friend chicken sandwich should be.  Pretzel was a bit smaller than I expected and I wish it was served warm! All the staff was very kind and helpful! Definitely ask for beer recommendations if you need it, you can ask for samples too before committing. I had a lot of fun here and will definitely be back"

My favorite drink is the radler which has a really light and refreshing sweetness. All the food I've tried here is also amazing - my favorites would have to be the jagerschnitzel, fingernudln, and currywurst.  Jagerschnitzel: this is huge - perfect to share between two people with moderate appetites, especially if you're planning on downing a beer or two. The pork was not dry at all and had a nice crisp to it, though I personally think it could have been slightly more crispy. The mushroom sauce was my favorite part though, soooo much umami and just so decadent.  Fingernudln: we got this in the summer when the fingernudln was paired with corn and it was so beautifully sweet and really made the corn a star! The texture of the fingernudln itself was also really nice and pillowy, not too dense.  Currywurst: Savory and juicy sausages with a lightly sweet and fragrant sauce - what else can you ask for?  Extra points for being super dog friendly!!"

Food wise, there are quite a few options all of which are German inspired. Mains are fairly expensive at $20-25 for most plates. I ordered the bratwurst which was excellent, but I was disappointed by the portion size. The plate came filled mostly with sauerkraut and some mashed potatoes.  They obviously have a ton of beer options, however when we came on a Sunday night they were out of many of the on tap choices.  We had a big group, but every time i have been to Radhaus the service has been fairly slow. This time, we got our food before beers which was interesting.  I'm not sure I will be back anytime soon, but this is a good place if you're looking to get just beers and with a smaller group."

A friend of mine suggested that we bike here along the water from the South Beach area. It was a gorgeous day and we put in that work so we could feast at Radhaus at the end, muahaha.  This place is gorgeous and the location is PRIME. We started with a Radler each and ordered a few dishes to share: - Brussels sprouts $12: OMG so good. The brussels are crispy and the fondue sauce is unreal. We spent half of our meal marveling at this dish & trying to figure out how to replicate it - Currywurst $23: pretty good, but not particularly memorable. Generous portion of fries - Pretzel w/ Obatzda $12: the cheese spread was super good  Overall, food & drink were good but felt slightly overpriced....then again, you look around at the prime location & setting and it all makes sense. I would return with a friend!"

We proceed to order the Dutch Crunch and the Acme Pain De Mie to which he then recommended accompanying our meal with some garlic waffle fries. This would be our first meal of the day so of course we said yes! We walked to the back where there were plenty of tables/seats as well as a ping pong table and Putterball (golf game). Such a fun way to make the time fly by while we wait for our food. After about 5 minutes Johnnie brought out the food on a platter and served it to us himself which was really cool! My mouth was watering as soon as I saw all of the tender pastrami stacked in between the toasted buns. Each bite was so juicy and full of flavor leaving me wanting more and more. Even though we got 6oz, I just felt like there could be more meat. The waffle fries had a subtle garlic flavor. I didn't see any actual garlic, so they likely either use garlic salt or garlic oil. Either way a nice compliment to our meal. As someone who has eaten at Katz Deli in NY, it is difficult to give this place a 5 considering how much food you get for the price. In terms of quality, both are top notch and taste phenomenal. Even though we shared, each sandwich just looked like it could be stacked even more. Overall, it's great to see someone who truly loves what they do and shares that same excitement and delicious food with the community. The relaxed and fun atmosphere is also a plus."

I was full with half, so I'm saving the other half for dinner. TEXAS TOAST is great if you love soft fluffy bread with a nice kick and mushrooms. This was my favorite! MARBLE RYE also had soft fluffy bread, but the sauce in there is a little different.

They were super friendly and came to check in on at the patio to make sure we enjoyed our food:)"

        "Shirley P.": "My partner and I came here to join their friends for the drag brunch on 4/16. My partner and I both have never been here before, and we came to support their friend Avery Daniels who was performing. Hot Johnnie's is located in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco. When I first walked in, I was immediately greeted by the friendly staff who checked our tickets from Eventbrite, and we were directed to the back where there's a heated patio with plenty of tables and chairs. The menu is displayed on the TV screen, and you can also order food and drinks off of the QR code on the TV screen. The staff also gladly break your bills up so you can tip the queens. It was such a fun time with great company, great food, great drinks, great vibes, and great drag. I'm so glad we were invited and we came. I loved seeing Mia Munro, Avery Daniels, Kipper Snacks, and Betty Fresas perform, they were all great at what they do individually, but I do love Betty Fresas a little bit more. She and Mia both perform next door at Midnight Suns as well. Johnnie the owner was there too, it's honestly great to see him bringing out food to guests (we love an owner who goes to the trenches with the staff), and I can appreciate him making his way around to say hi to everyone and make sure we're doing good. I ordered their fried chicken tenders plate that came with three types of sauces (ranch, chipotle, and ketchup) and waffle fries -- the fried chicken tenders are to die for, it's so tender and juicy, and the skin is so crispy on the outside. It's some of the best tenders I've ever had. I also had a gut feeling that their house chips were going to be amazing, I was right, and I ended up having 3 rounds of them because they're that great. It's so crispy, light, airy, and seasoned to perfection. I'm sad that my trip is over, but I'll definitely be back here for many reasons -- great food, great atmosphere, and even their outdoor decor was cute. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a bite to eat, they're known for their sandwiches, they have bottomless mimosas etc."

        "Hector L.": "Really enjoyed our dining experience here. Came to celebrate a birthday. We were seated in the main area. Lighting was dimmed a bit to set a more intimate mood.  We shared everything we ordered. Started with the snap pea salad and duck liver pate. Salad was fresh and the duck liver pate was earthy but offset by the sweetness of the strawberry jam. For our mains, we ordered the fusilli and the wagyu beef. The sauce on the fusilli was rich but not too thick. The beef was very tender and served with potatoes and mushrooms.  Our two desserts were both very good, but preferred the bread pudding over the panna cotta. Highly recommend reservations."

        "John W.": "One on my favorite local Italian spots. Every time I return, it just reinforces the reason why I keep coming back. The dishes are consistently delicious. They have excellent service. The ambiance is comfortable, casual and chill, with small neighborhood vibe. Chef Tony and team offers creative nightly specials based on what's fresh locally that day. A sign of true passion for creativity, offering the freshest ingredients to diners, and providing support for local purveyors. The dishes: -Duck liver pate - rich and luscious pate smeared on toasted crostone, topped with kumquat marmalade served with a side of wild arugula. -Dungeness crab with squid ink linguine (special of the night) - fresh house made squid ink linguine prepared al dente, topped with a generous portion of fresh chunks of Dungeness crab meat served in a light cream sauce. -Imperial Wagyu flat iron steak - perfectly prepared tender Wagyu served with a delicious Black Trumpet mushroom jus, accompanied with asparagus and Mokum carrots. -Chocolate Budino - perfectly sweetened, served with hazelnuts, sea salt, Chantilly cream, and biscotti. Thank you Chef Tony and team for another impeccable experience. See y'all next time. :)"

        "Stephanie N.": "Another superb experience here. First of all, our waitress KimThi was such a pleasure. Such a sweet, good humored person, and friendly yet efficient. All the other staff who brought our dishes were really friendly too! Just adds that extra cozy something to an already wonderful meal. Second of all, our meal felt so elegantly creative without being pretentious. The yellowtail appetizer special looked and tasted like Spring, with bright, green, and early springtime flavors. The kumquat marmalade on the duck pate appetizer was so unique (the flavors together weren't quite a match for my personal taste, but I enjoyed them separately and my dining companion loved the combination). Finally, the pastas were a delight: the tortelli felt decadent but nuanced, without being cloyingly rich, and we were lucky to be there when there was a pasta special topped with plenty of sweet Dungeness crab. It seems like this restaurant really likes to incorporate seasonal ingredients without making a big fuss about it. Anyways, this was a hit, we will be back, and we highly recommend!"

Loved the the texture of the pasta and the flavor was so well balanced) - winter citrus salad (they use seasonal produce and it's easy to tell! They made use of a mandoquat fruit hybrid and it was great) - panna cotta (more mandoquat in action, again not complaining) Would definitely go back for other items."

Every pasta was above expectations - particularly the the truffle tortelloni. I tried a little bit of everything in their menu. The crab ink pasta and truffle pasta special were to die for. Their pate crostini and salad were very packed in flavour. The desserts were excellent - taking my hat off for their panna cotta. Delicious! Service was impeccable and the ambiance was pretty modern Italian. Fresh and delicious - will come back !"

        "Aretha D.": "I've tried a lot of Italian places in the city, and this easily takes the cake. My friend and I walked in on a Saturday night with no reservation and got sat down immediately. The ambiance is cozy, intimate--truly the perfect place to wind down.  We started off with the herb focaccia and duck liver pate. The focaccia was extremely fragrant, and truly enhanced the complimentary olive oil. The delightful candied kumquat cut through the duck liver pt, a flavor combo I really wasn't expecting. This antipasti was crunchy, creamy, sweet, and bitter from the arugula-frise mix. I would definitely recommend. For our entrees, my friend and I split the Fussili Lunghi and Pappardelle. You can tell that the pasta is extremely fresh as every bite had a bounce to it. The sauce of each dish was seasoned incredibly well and I left feeling very satisfied. On top of all the amazing food, our waitress Kim really took care of us and was so attentive to our needs. Her service was the cherry on top. I'll definitely be recommending this place to all my friends."

        "Karen Z.": "Nice restaurant with great food! They are famous for their Maccheroncelli, which is indeed pretty good. Our waiter suggested ordering meatball from antipasti with it, and the two does go pretty well! However, I like the crab squid ink infused pasta better. It has a very fresh taste and a lot of crab meat on top! It is one of their specials. The portion seems small, but it was more filling than we expected! ~$55 post tip and tax, great place for a catch up or a date"

        "Harry L.": "Seven Hills. I had heard those two words from many a friend over the past few months and I finally was able to get reservations, for my birthday no less! We trundled out on a rainy Monday night in San Francisco and got seated for our 8 pm reservations indoors. The restaurant was in a sleepier part of Russian Hill and surprisingly, there was no issue finding parking at all for us. We rushed into the restaurant to get out of the rain and got comfortable. Food review: Garlic & Parmesan Focaccia 5/5 - Yes. Yes. Yes. Three yeses. The focaccia had the most amazing texture with the parmesan creating a nice, crisp layer on top. What was so wonderful about this app was that the dough was seemingly made with whole grain or some other type of flour, not white flour. It gave it that much more bite. Get this no matter what! Tomato Braised Polpette 4.75/5 - There's something so classic about red sauce and meatballs. This dish takes that to a whole new level, with the sauce itself providing umami and pops of acidity throughout the whole dish. Spectacular. The only thing I would've wanted a bit more of is more of a prominent, deeper flavor in the tomato sauce but otherwise, sooooo good. Tagliolini all'Amatriciana 5/5 - Yummmmm. Oh my goodness the noodles were cooked the PERFECT al dente here. The bits of pancetta mixed in with the sauce provided little surprises here and there. It was such a nice dish - loved every second of it. Tagliatelle Pork Rib Sugo 5/5 - This was my favorite item of the night and I cleaned it up. The pork rib sugo was just mindblowing in flavor. The strands of pork rib meat between the al dente noodles were so good. The width of the noodles were a perfect vehicle for the sauce to rest on when taking bites of the dish. 1000% get this if you see it on the daily menu. Okay, okay this place absolutely lives up to the hype. For all the friends that were talking about this place, now there's one more friend talking about this place - me! Go please, you won't regret it!"

        "Lori R.": "4.5/5 overall but the pasta and duck pate 5/5  I don't go out to pasta restaurants often but when I do I hope they are good and Seven Hills delivered. So far this is the best pasta I've had in the city - perfectly aldente pasta in a well balanced sauce and fresh ingredients meld together to create a delicious dish. AND the portions are good- not some skimpy serving of pasta that you feel robbed over- but the right amount where you are satisfied and also not feeling like you need to unbutton and be rolled out and will have meat/cheese sweats later.  We started with the bread and duck pate. Duck pate is a must- amazing texture and flavor that is well balanced with a preserve (kumquat was ours) and salad. Bread was just okay (granted the restaurant we ate out the prior week was automat and their focaccia is just on another level). I got the special pasta - squid ink with fresh crab; the squid ink pasta had the perfect bite. The garlic lemon sauce stuck just enough to the pasta to give enough of a flavor to the pasta and crab without overpowering either. The crab was SOOOO sweet and fresh - in nice large chunks as well. I would have licked the plate if the venue wasn't so nice haha  The Maccheroncelli was also to die for- pasta once again cooked perfectly; ever pasta was like a nice little bouncy ball of carbs and sauce. The sauce on this one was the right balance of salt, sweetness and acidity. The cheese was fun to mix into bites as the creaminess it provided elevated the dish even more . Overall - even though I am not a pasta restaurant fan I would definitely come back."

        "Carey F.": "Hostess was not super friendly and did not greet us with a smile. So we immediately felt a bit on the defensive and recalibrated our expectations.  Thankfully the food was delicious!  Soup: carrot pure with chives and a very fragrant, minty herb. Rich, slightly sweet and delicious.  Beet salad: delightful mix of red and orange beets together with frisee and radicchio. Dressing light and not overpowering.  House focaccia: slightly warmed with olive oil. Solid.  Squid ink pasta with dungeoness crab: outstanding! Slightly tangy and buttery sauce. Pasta was perfectly al dente. Just the way it's supposed to be.  Pappardelle: tender braised beef. Tomato and Romano sauce was excellent. And the texture of the pasta was amazing!  Date cake: super moist, and not overpoweringly sweet. I'm typically not a dessert person. But I polished it off.  Lastly, shout out to our server. I don't know her name, but she appeared to be Asian with shorter hair. She went out of her way to expertly explain all the dishes and answer questions related to different dishes. Super friendly service.  And another shout out to the rest of the wait staff who were spot on in replacing utensils, refilling beverages and keeping the table tidy.  We enjoyed our visit to the restaurant and hope to be back!"

We came on a busy night with a reservation but were still seated about an hour after arriving. Luckily we were able to put in our orders while we were still seated in the waiting area, but our food did still take a while to arrive after we got a table. Small note, we did end up getting 2 tables of different shapes which made it a little difficult to place the dishes (only noticed this since we ordered family style & had to keep rearranging)! All around, we enjoyed the food! We were expecting a little more texture and flavor from the veggie momos, but the tofu chow mein definitely impressed the whole group!

        "Amy L.": "You must add Base Camp to your list of restaurants to visit in SF. First off, the price and quality of the food were great. Plus, the service was solid. To start, we ordered the blackberry rooibos tea that smelled really fruity, but didn't taste as fruity as we expected. No big deal though, it was still a solid drink. As for the food, we got a bunch of dishes to share including spicy cauliflower, eggplant curry, lamb curry, basmati rice, and naan. The spicy cauliflower was bomb - it had an amazing breading and just the right amount of spice. The lamb curry was also super tasty - the flavors were on point and the meat tasted fresh. The only bummer was the eggplant curry - it was kinda bland and had a consistency like baby food. But hey, you can't win 'em all, right? Oh, and the naan was legit. They give you six good-sized pieces, and they're so fluffy. If I had to do it over, I'd probably get one curry and another big dish, so that there was more variety in food textures. Overall, Base Camp is a great spot to grab some killer Nepalese food without breaking the bank. The food rocks, the service is on point, and the vibe is just right. Check it out!"

        "Denny D.": "This place is such a hole in the wall, it's located in the Mission district away from all the hustle and bustle of Valencia street. I've never tried Nepali cuisine before and wow it was so so delicious. We ordered the fried chicken, chicken momo, onion fritters, butter chicken, and garlic naan. I was blown away by all the dishes that we ordered, the quality of food and it was all very filling. The dish that surprised me was the onion fritters since it came with the sides of two sauces. The contrast from the sweet/bitterness of the onion with the sweetness of the sauce is so good. The restaurant itself is not too big, so on busy nights.. expect a wait but the wait it worth it! The staff was so friendly and attentive, the food came out quickly as well. I definitely recommend this place for groups and date nights. I am looking forward to coming back!"

        "Jocelyn K.": "My party of 4 made a reservation for Saturday dinner at 7:15pm and the place was already packed when we got there, so we had to wait another 10 minutes before we got seated. Our table was at the very front of the restaurant where people entering and exiting the restaurant would periodically run into the people sitting on the outside edge of our table. It wasn't the biggest deal, but I did wish that we were seated somewhere with less foot traffic for a better experience overall.  The service was quick right when we were seated - staff members would check-in periodically and refill our waters timely. However, the food did come out a bit slow. We got 2 appetizers and 3 main dishes to share. The curries do not automatically come with rice or naan, so you have to order them additionally. All the dishes we got were flavorful and seasoned well. My favorite would probably be the goat curry as it was of a thinner consistency which didn't make it feel heavy, and the meat was super tender without tasty too gamey (which I find can often happen with goat dishes).  Overall, the space inside felt nice and comfortable, and I'd definitely recommend making a reservation to secure a spot. They also provided mints and herb mixture as breath freshness and a palette cleanser for after your meal, which was fun to try."

We got the outside seating because the indoors was full but we had the outdoor heaters , do that was good. The first thing I was disappointed with was the number of momo per order. . Never had such small portion before. The momos were mediocre with almost no filling. The sauce however was amazingggg. The chowmein was mediocre as well. Sweeter than it should have been. The Cashew paneer curry was the star of the night. Overall, decent food but won't be going back unless I don't have any other option. Not being its bad. But because nothing stands out - the ambience, the food and the service are all mediocre."

The service staff is also super kind, accommodating and friendly.  The food standout by far was the garlic naan. It's up there for the best naan I've ever had. Portion size phenomenal, taste on point, enough garlic where you know what you ordered and are happy but not too much where vampires run away.  Sadly the rest of the food was very okay. No complaints but it all came out very much on the sweeter side. Perhaps we should've asked for spicy but it was across the board on everything we ordered. Dal Makhani & Kale Chaat. Def willing to give it another try by varying what is ordered and upping the spice but there are other places that hit the spot that I'd rather return to first."

        "Caesar A.": "It isn't necessary to ascend Mt Everest to enjoy some Nepalese food at Base Camp. No Sherpa required, just walk in or if you prefer, call for a reservation. The space is quite small, music a bit loud and depending on how many to go orders have been phoned in; the one server may take a bit to get to you. The server last night was very friendly and helpful. At $9 we tried an order of their four pork Momo's with dipping sauce. They we very flavorful and we'd highly recommend trying out these little gems. At $18 we really enjoyed the Pork Chowmein. This is not at all anything like the usual Chinese Chowmein. The noodles were not too soft yet they were a bit sweet for my tastes. Next assent, I will definitely order them again and ask if the sweetness can descend just a bit. At $22 the Fish (Salmon) Curry seemed a bit small. If sharing with two or more friends, each will only have a bite. Although this contained a few clams, scallop, prawn and salmon we will not order it one again. I really believe a white flakey fish instead of salmon would be a much better choice for this dish. And, at $4 we ordered the Garlic Naan. This was a bit too bready and dry for all of us thus we will also skip this one next visit as well. I think it would be a good idea to order almost every starter and make dinner out of them. This way we can have a real sense of what this food is all about, enjoy."

If you're staying here for more than a glass, you'll definitely have plenty of options to snack on.  All of the staff members were friendly but my one qualm is service was super slow. It took 15-20 minutes for someone to take our order and bring us water. (I was fine picking up a bottle of water myself, but the employee said she'd bring one over.)

        "Rachel H.": "Casual wine-bar, backyard patio meets wine shop in Hayes Valley, Birba has a decidedly easy going feel. Its a woman-run business, and owner Angela Valgiusti, has brought over a decade of experience as a sommelier and restaurant manager to the task when starting Birba, which means \"little troublemaker.\"  The menu features dips, homemade sesame flatbread, cheese, charcuterie all to pair with wine, served by the bottle or the glass. Favorite items for us included several choices in whites, reds and bubbly wines on their wine list by the glass and an even more extensive list by the bottle. There are about a dozen options on the food menu all that pair well with an extensive by the glass wine selection. We enjoyed everything, particularly their salmon dip and housemade sesame flatbread. Best to come here to Birba on days you want to sit outside and drink wine. The patio is roomy, but indoor dining space is limited and doubles as a wine shop. Customers get a significant bottle discount when adding a to-go wine (or two) onto a food a drinks bill at Birba."

        "Jason F.": "There are a number of intriguing options when looking for a libation or a quick bite to eat when walking around San Francisco's Hayes Valley neighborhood, which is a trendy area near both City Hall and the city's theatre, but Birba is a true standout. It definitely has that unique feeling of being a secret watering hole that only locals seem to visit as their storefront is completely unassuming as it resembles more of a European wine bar than more of a traditional wine bar. Apparently all of the fun is happening in their lively backdoor patio or on their makeshift outdoor patio that occupies the front entrance to their bar on Grove Street, which is the street that a friend and I walked down from the Orpheum Theatre after a weekday matinee show ended. After looking at my trusty Yelp app for nearby places to the Orpheum that actually opened earlier than the normal dinner hours, Birba was one of the few places to actually be open. When we arrived after taking a hearty walk down Grove Street to get to their location, their associate instructed us to leave a credit card with their front counter so we could open a tab, and then walk through their narrow bar and bottle shop and head towards their heated back patio which served as an expansive urban oasis shrouded with trees and crisscrossed with hanging lights, away from all of the nearby traffic. The food menu at Birba is compact and broken up into sections such as Dips & Veggies, Meat & Cheese, Tinned Fish and Antipasti Bar. But it is their wine menu that sets Birba apart from their competitors, as it is a multi-page affair, full of classic and natural wines in most every style imaginable. Almost fifty wines are available by the glass, and many more by the bottle, which understandably can be easily overwhelming for any wine novice or veteran quite frankly as there are so many options to choose from. But we opted to share a bottle of 2021 Damien Martin Saint-Veran Chardonnay, which had strong flavors of citrus and an aroma of stone fruit and verbena, and gave our overall meal nice richness with every sip. We chose three menu items to dine on including their Deviled Eggs, which were topped with Calabrian chili oil and pickled jalapeos; their Smoked Salmon Dip, which was served with creme fraiche, dill and slices of endive and sesame seeded crackers; and from their Tinned Fish section of their menu we chose their Marinated Mussels, which were served with marinated lima beans and a side of crackers and lemon. Our chilled bottle arrived in due time and once opened and poured it was lovely to catch up with my friend on their back patio with the heated lamps overhead. When our dishes arrived the highlight for me was their tinned fish as both the mussels and the beans were covered in a marinade that had me craving for more and both seafood dishes, the mussels and the salmon dip, paired so lovely with our Chardonnay as it brought out the fruit flavor with every sip.  To end our meal, we wanted something sweet so my friend headed back into their wine shop to see what sweets were available and saw that they were selling chocolate bars sourced from Ritual Chocolate. So she selected two handcrafted bars including one Dark Mocha and one Honeycomb Toffee both of which paired nicely with our sweet Chardonnay. Birba has a fun energy to it that resembles something out of a narrow alleyway in Europe, with its wide array of wines to select from and their uniquely crafted menu of small plates that branches beyond the predictable meat-and-cheese boards that can give any wine lovers' taste buds a considerable jolt. If there seems like too much to select from on their massive wine menu, I suggest that one simply asks their staff of experts who seem to know information about every bottle of wine they sell here. Our total bill before tip was over $130 but much of that bill can be attributed to our bottle of wine as well as the two bars of chocolate, as the food is more decently priced considering the amount you receive. I plan on returning to Birba for many more visits as the atmosphere and wine selection make it one of the best wine bars in not just the neighborhood but the entire city."

        "Fernando F.": "OK, so this place is another hole-in-the-wall spot that honestly holds a lot more than what meets the eye. When I first chose this for a quick little tapas date, I was thinking we could just sit in front of the restaurant and grab a few options. Little did I know when I walked into the locale that I would be welcomed into a mini oasis. From the pictures or maybe I missed it, I did not see the entire back patio area. I expected to sit out front and enjoy the vibes there. However, I walked into a wonderful array of wines in the store and the back being beautiful. As we were doing tapas, we kept it light and grabbed a few options that we knew we could much on including the pistachio feta dip, burrata and marinated artichokes. All of these were wow. What we ordered: Pistachio feta dip: Heavy delicious pistachio flavor with some feta afternotes. You ended up getting a good amount (we took some home as we couldn't eat all of that) with some vegetables. Burrata (w/ prosciutto): WOW, honestly one of the best burratas that I have had. It was flavorful and the prosciutto on the side only augmented that flavor a little more and gave it just the touch it needed Marinated artichokes: This one threw me for a loop. I don't normally eat artichokes, so it was new, but I did enjoy these. I would go back and have it again. Service was great and they are attentive. They take your card after you order and then you pay upon exit, so there will be no one rushing you with a check."

The outdoor dining here is beautiful; there is a patio in the back with lights and plants and it's such a pretty vibe :) We ordered the cheese plate, sardines, and Birba Spritz. It did take a bit of time for them to take our order but the food/drinks came out quickly! The Birba spritz was nice and strong, and the food was light and tasty. This is the perfect spot for after-work bites & drinks and I can't wait to come back again!"

There was ample heating around the cozy and beautifully designed space.  It felt like a small oasis and even better because of their diverse wine selection! There were a few small plates and food choices but I didn't get a chance to snack on those since I had a dinner rez right after. The people around us had a yummy looking charcuterie board that I was definitely eyeing for next time.  I enjoyed a Birba Spritz which was under the \"bubbles\" section. It had a lovely refreshing taste with a lemon twist. The people working were also very nice and friendly! What a nice surprise to find in SF."

Got lunch to-go and it was so good we came back for dinner the same night to get the same dish. The hostess/server during lunch was super nice but the server during dinner had a bit of a stink face (maybe she was over customers...idk). The vibe of this place is so cute and homey, it's a really cute date night spot.  At dinner we got two pappardelle pasta, herbed onion bread, and an espresso shot. Of course, the pasta was amazing, however the herbed onion bread was just regular bread with no flavor so I would pass on it next time. The espresso shot was really good too!"

Although the burrata bruschetta is a bit expensive, the cheese, the hazelnut, and the honey go very well together, and I consider it a must try! Service (5/5): We were seated promptly, and the food came out at a reasonable time as well. Ambiance (5/5): The restaurant is well decorated and clean! It is located in a relatively nice area of SOMA as well. Overall (5/5): I have been here a few times now over the years, and I haven't been disappointed! It is a bit expensive for a few of the dishes, but I would recommend checking this place out."

To start we had the burrata bruschetta. That was my first time having a bruschetta like that, and I think it was amazing. I am not always a fan of tomatoes, so it was a nice change. I wish the bread was thicker to be able to hold all of the toppings. Also, I think the selection of bread was not my favorite, but I would order it again. So my thoughts are merely suggestions and do not take away from the app.  I also tried one of the pasta dishes. I do not remember the name but it had pork in it. I thought is was good. I would not need to get it again, only because I would want to try something different. Overall the service was good, the food came out quickly and the ambiance was pleasant."

Still thinking about that cake. Service was kind and attentive. An amazing dinner."

        "Jessica F.": "The mezzemani eggplant pasta dish was perfectly Al dente with really satisfying soft chunks of eggplant and mozzarella squares. I loved the spice level of the sausage pizza- the Goldilocks zone of flavor not too spicy and not too bland. Margherita had a great Basil to sauce to cheese ratio. It would be nice if the sausage was spread out more evenly and the pizza was just a tiny bit less weighed down and soggy at the center by its ingredients. Pretty good value for notoriously overpriced SF- 3 dishes were extremely filling for a pair. We even had some slices to go to heat up in the air fryer later. Overall, good service and good food and a very nice, hip ambiance. Definitely a great stop if you're craving Italian for a quick bite in downtown SF!"

The mushroom pizza was flavorful and crispy thin crust. The chicken parmesan was seasoned well and complemented the tomato sauce. The burrata bruschetta was wonderfully toasted and creamy, the hazelnut and honey are the perfect pair. They have crispy thin crust pizza and it's bomb. Can't recommend this place enough!"

They took it out of their menu for a while and I'm so happy to see it back.  Margherita with buratta is good too and one of my favorite pizzas in the city. Crab arancini is also good though I find it taste a little \"fishy\" and so I might not order it again. The place itself is also great with lots of light and big windows which I like. They play hiphop music which I find a little loud sometimes but it's okay. The service was so-so. I've been there two days in a row, one for takeout and one for dine in and both times the staffs seemed to not care when they (or maybe they don't) see people waiting to be helped. They choose to talk to their coworkers instead of helping just-arrived customers. They didn't have host or anything at that time so it looked like whoever staff has the interest would help customers get seated or take their to-go orders. If it wasn't for this which I experienced twice in a row (friday and Saturday afternoon), I would've gave this place 5 stars."

        "Gabriella W.": "Delarosa was delicious! It was my first time visiting SF and my friend mentioned he'd been trying to get a reservation at Delarosa but it never worked out. Luckily they had a table for two at prime time on a Saturday.  When we walked in for our reservation we were greeted quickly and brought to our table. Then we sat for 10 minutes without being acknowledged. It was busy but plenty of servers passed our table and said nothing so we just waited. By the time someone finally came over we were ready to place our entire order. We did the proscuitto di parma pizza and the chicken parm penne.  The pizza was my favorite part. I'm picky about chicken parm but this one was pretty good. On the thicker side and covered in sauce so not the most crisp. Flavors were there though! The space seemed pretty big. We were tucked in the back corner which conveniently featured their neon sign which made for the perfect photo op and backdrop for our food pictures. My favorite part of the ambiance was that they had a rack of hangers next to their longer tables. Super cute! If I end up back in the SF area I'd definitely go back to Delarosa!"

They charge an extra 5% which they state at the very bottom of their menu. The servers certainly don't show much effort or attention to diners from what we experienced.  Food was just OK. Surprisingly, the salad with beets, kale, and goat cheese had the best flavor. The herbed onion bread had nice texture and crunch but sorta bland otherwise."

        "Michael W.": "The service was really amazing, and the cocktails were divine, but the food was just okay. The burrata bruschetta was good in concept but that much honey made it taste like Cheerios. The Margherita pizza? If I wanted oregano on a pizza, I'd go to Chuck E Cheese. The crust had no sour or yeast flavor. No flavor at all, really. Disappointing. Maybe we need to order different things next time but this wasn't great."

Most SF restaurants are a 1/4 of the size. The open space adds to the breezy, fun atmosphere. Our server was fun, kind and had a wealth of recommendations.  Served in a coconut cup and garnished with a lime slice and orchid, our Pina Coladas were fun to drink and tasted delicious. The spicy bloody mary's were a hit. There are a host of tropical, fiery and botanical cocktails. The bar itself is an apothecary of Caribbean party favors - dried pineapple wedges, sliced limes, orchid flowers, and shelves upon shelves of rum, tequila and mezcal.  We kicked off with sesame chicken wings. They were sticky, spicy and just the right kind of messy. Everyone ordered a little something different - squash salads, banana bread french toast, coconut wedge salad, island breakfast and the pineapple fried rice served inside of a grilled pineapple.  We left feeling happy and stuffed, the perfect end to a mini vacation!"

Definitely recommend reserving since there's almost always a wait. I have given 4 stars since we made a reservation and the lady at the restaurant told us that we didn't have one. I was a little annoyed that the systems were not updated!! Then they tried to seat us smack dab under the sun where there was no shade and I refused. We had to wait but we're finally seated.  This is a dog friendly restaurant so I was delighted to have brunch with furry friends. The food is A++. They have an in-house banana macadamia nut milk which is divine. You just have to try something with this milk....it is delish. The food was super fresh and the presentation was good too. I really liked this place for the fact that they have healthy options. The ambiance was great!! There is also a larger seating area at the back of you want to host an event."

The drinks menu is full of fun tropical cocktails. I ordered the palm house spritz and the crisp air. Preferred the crisp air to the spritz because the spritz was just very mild, and tasted like a pleasant watery sparkling juice. The rosemary in the crisp air was nice. My boyfriend also got the fried chicken sandwich, and enjoyed it (especially the slice of pineapple)."

We were able to make a reservation for 12 about 2 weeks before and things fell right into place and was well organized. When there we ended up ordering: * coconut prawns - these were yummy and crispy which I enjoyed and definitely had the coconut flavor which added some sweetness * guacamole - this is standard, but as always a great dish to share with the table *fried chicken sandwich with fries - this was yummy and flavorful, I split it with the boy as we weren't too hungry and we both thoroughly enjoyed the dish *butternut squash soup - this was a little bland for my liking - think it definitely needed more flavor  Overall the food and service was pretty good - they also brought out mango slushie shots for the table and gave dessert (we got the banana pie) which was super sweet.

It felt like a little slice of paradise in the city when we came here for brunch. Nice service but a bit slow and it took a while for us to have our orders taken. We enjoyed our food, especially the chicken on the chicken and waffles (the waffle was a bit too dry and rough.) I think the ambiance is the main component that would draw me back here!

We didn't of course, and just gives us more reason to come back in the future. The banana bread French toast was just right. It was not too sweet and was perfect as a dessert. Any other time depending on meal you had, probably would have been too heavy - But I only had ahi tuna, so was perfect."

        "Jessica T.": "Dropped in with a friend around 8pm on a Saturday night. All the indoor seats were taken, so were seated at the outdoor tables. Palm House gave off more bar vibes than restaurant vibes.  The music inside was really loud and there were really loud people as well. They have 3 single stall bathrooms. When I went, only 1 of the bathrooms actually locked, which was really awkward.  We waited 20-30 mins for our food to arrive and were really disappointed.  Fried Chicken Sandwich: 1/5 This was not what I was expecting at all. The coleslaw was really strong and overpowered the taste of the burger. The chicken itself didn't have a flavor, it was pretty bland. Nothing really stood out about this and I ended up not finishing it Spiced Fries: 2/5 This was possibly the best part of the meal, but I've had these same fries at C-tier boba shops -- known as \"Cajun Fries.\" These fries are dry on the inside, kinda crispy, and are powdered with chili spice. I was expecting a little more with this meal but it was ok.  Macaroni Salad: 1/5 Do not recommend. This macaroni was sour, which was unexpected. It was unlike anything I've ever tasted before. There's scallions and carrots and some tangy dressing. It was not my cup of tea.  Also, the service was pretty slow and our waiter just disappeared for a while. For a 4-star eatery, I was kinda disappointed by the quality of food and I won't be coming back again."

The flavors were just as unapologetic, and I savored every bite and then packed the rest to-go when the heat got too much for me. If you're in the mood to go to town on a bowl of noodles, you've found the right place!!  The noodle soups are the signature dishes, but go for the dry/cold noodles if you're in the mood for something saucy and savory. Don't sleep on the side dishes, either - the braised pork intestine was divine and I only regret not having room to try more! Sweet & sour spare ribs were a bit dry and a lot of bone, even for Chinese-style spare ribs (usually lots of bone/cartilage to gnaw on, unlike American-style ribs that have lots of meat). Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"

We ordered the braised pork intestine noodle soup, the hot and sour noodle soup, Chongqing spicy noodle, and wontons with spicy oil.  The flavors started out strong, with all the noodles numbing, spicy, and savory. The pork intestines noodle soup also had that distinct offal-y flavor, which could be a bit strong if you aren't used to it. But as the meal progressed, the noodle soups began to taste more similar and heavy from all the chili oil. In the end, we had to pack most of them to go, but the spicy, oily soup kept us warm as we headed back out to brave the cold SF night."

Wuhan Hot Dry Noodles - 5/5 - this was my favorite dish!! spicy, peanuty, pickley, and packed with a lot of flavor! the noodles were just right as well. i would recommend for those who don't like saucy or soupy noodles Bean Jello in Red Chili Sauce - 4/5 - i've never had bean jello so it was interesting! bean jello doesn't have that much flavor while the red chili sauce and black beans make up for that flavor. the black beans were the best part of it Szechuan Mouth Watering Chicken - 3.5/5 - this dish was good but i didn't expect there to be bones. flavor wise, it was similar to the chili sauce in the bean jello. the chicken was nice and tender. Overall, a good place if you like numbing spice. Beware that the food has a lot of oil due to the chili sauces. My one con was that the togo boxes were filled to the top with sauces for the appetizers so it was hard to open if without splashing sauce or oil on your clothes/table.  I have no pictures since I was too busy eating!! xD"

        "Tracey A.": "It's a chicken and egg thing: Did the SF Chronicle write-up bring the crowd or did the crowd cause the SF Chronicle write-up?  On a recent visit to Chinatown, I walked by mostly empty restaurants with mostly poor yelp ratings en route to the full-at-lunchtime Chong Qing Xiao Mian (CQXM). I'd had it bookmarked since at least one year ago when my notes indicated that the Chronicle had described \"massive portions of spicy noodle soups\" and \"Tan Tan Noodles...that'll keep you coming back for more\".  I didn't save that write-up but I can bet they weren't touting the great service or the restaurant's cleanliness. Neither would be anything to remark kindly upon.  But the noodles... I opted for those Tan Tan Noodles (about $15) and was pleased. These are big bowls of satisfying fare.  The server had inquired of my preferred spice level (medium) but by the time she got through all the back and forth with the friend I'd brought she repeated our order saying \"Tan Tan Noodles mild\" before spiriting away. So mine were \"mild\" and though I'd still have preferred \"medium\" spice levels what arrived pleased me.  If you're searching for Chinese (Sichuan in this case) noodles CQXM should simplify the search. I'd definitely return."

With a somewhat limited menu, it's easy to select what looks good to you and everything here is pretty good. If you're unable to handle spicy, there are like 2 dishes that are neutral. I recommend getting the Dan Dan Noodles which was a favorite on our table, the Braised Pork Intestine Noodle Soup, and the GuiLin Beef Noodle Soup for those who cannot handle the spiciness! One fun one was also the House Cold Noodles which had a nutty and sesame sauce."

The waffle was crispy on the outside and soft / fluffy on the inside, the chicken was super juicy and flavorful, and the syrup just brought everything together. If you love sweet & savory, GET THIS! My friend got the shakshouka which came with a side plate of hummus & pita. I tried some of her shakshouka and thought it was really good as well."

        "Mikaela S.": "I came here for brunch around 11:30 AM and it was a great experience. We waited just 10 minutes or so to be seated. It is a smaller place but food is out very fast and the service is good. We ordered the nasi goreng and chicken plate and then the breakfast egg sandwich with chicken on the side that we put inside. I really liked the chicken, which was well seasoned and juicy. The nasi goreng was also well seasoned and a generous portion. Lastly, the sandwich was great and served on a soft brioche bun with a yummy aioli sauce. We really enjoyed the food overall and will definitely be back.  One wish that I would have is for them to turn their chicken into chicken strips and make a combo with fries and a great sauce. I think their chicken would be absolutely perfect for it."

        "Erythr S.": "Birdsong is the place to be. The restaurant offers a tasting menu that showcases some of the best seasonal and locally-sourced ingredients, all of which are subject to change to reflect the freshest produce available. The meal starts with a bang with the shigoku oysters served in chicken fat and cauliflower, a dish that perfectly balances the richness of the fat with the briny, fresh oysters. Next up is the mt. lassen creek-raised trout, served in a root broth with braised wakame, smoked mussels, and shrimp, all of which come together to create a harmonious, umami-packed flavor profile. One of the standout dishes is the sea urchin cream puff, which features fermented shiitake and savory butterscotch. The pastry is light and airy, providing the perfect backdrop for the creamy, indulgent sea urchin filling. Another highlight is the quail, which is lacquered and smoked and served with grilled Parker House rolls. The combination of the tender, smoky quail and the buttery, fluffy rolls is simply heavenly. Vegetarians will also be impressed with Birdsong's offerings, such as the BBQ carrot with preserved tops and huckleberries, which delivers a surprising depth of flavor despite its humble ingredients. The aged lamb loin is another carnivorous option, cooked over the fire and served with mustard greens, while the douglas fir yogurt with mandarin and olive oil provides a refreshing and tangy interlude before the sweet desserts. The meal ends on a high note with the meyer lemon and rose dessert, a beautifully presented dish that features the delicate, floral flavor of rose and the bright citrus notes of meyer lemon. The entire meal is a culinary journey that will leave you feeling satisfied and impressed by the creativity and skill of the chefs at Birdsong."

Excellent service overall and an absolutely delight. I hope to come back someday.  February Menu shigoku oysters - one of my favorite oyster dishes I've ever had chicken fat, cauliflower creek-raised trout roe, chestnut, pomegranate, fish bone sabayon tail end prepared like lox, puffed skin, fresh milk curd loin cured in cedar, nasturtium, pine needle condiment root broth - light and deliicous braised wakame, smoked mussels, shrimp sea urchin cream puff - so much sea urchin. the butterscotch was a bit overwhelming flavor wise fermented shiitake, savory butterscotch cornbread. caviar & walnuts - one of the highlights of the meal. I dont think i've ever had this much caviar on a single dish  quail, lacquered & smoked - construct your own sandwich with grilled parker house rolls. this was an absolute delight and definitely one of the highlights bbg carrot - can't say I've ever eaten a carrot with so much work put into it. basically smoked just like meat aged lamb loin - mustard greens cooked over the fire Both desserts were amazing here. Usually the michelin meals have lacking desserts but I loved both of the ones here.  douglas fir yogurt, mandarin, olive oil meyer lemon & rose * rose milk & meringue * meyer lemon ice cream * floral milk taffy"

From the rustic feel of the restaurant to the efficient service of food, it was truly a lovely dining experience.  A grand menu for sure, but my favorites included : - the root broth: such a warm and comforting soup - sea urchin cream puff: perhaps one of the most perfect, tasty bites of food I have ever had -cornbread and caviar: so soft, moist, and uniquely delicious  Highly recommend coming here to celebrate a special occasion!"

        "Ashutosh K.": "So, Birdsong became my spot this year to celebrate my birthday. I booked a chef's table seat for 1. Typically, they only offer 6 pm seating for 1 guest reservations. And, I had booked that, but closer to the reservation, I saw other chef's table spots for later times available and requested to move my reservation to a later time - a more suitable dinner time for me :). I got 7:30 pm one. And, I arrived a little early. Fun aspect was that I got the corner seat, right next to where Chef Christopher Bleidorn was running the service from. So, i got to chat with him on and off, and he also kept checking if my favorite dish of the evening remained cream puff and uni.  I was enjoying the theatrics of every kitchen counter - from oyster and foam prep to smoking the bread and crisping the squab. It was awesome. And, the uni and cream puff - so sublime that i can still remember the flavors after a week! When i asked the chef serving me the uni dish where the uni is from, I couldn't understand the answer and asked a couple of times. Then Chef Bleidorn came over and said it is actually from fort bragg. And, he also mentioned that he tried to take that dish off the menu but guest got crazy - I can vouch for that! Haha.. i had the same reaction hearing about that dish going out of menu! One after another, great dishes were served and i gobbled them up haha. I had not told about my birthday when making the reservation, but mentioned to the chef during convo. He apparently had one of the service staff print a birthday menu for me, and I got a birthday sunday too! The couple next to me was also celebrating birthday and we joked about how each of us get asked by almost everyone about so close to being a leap year baby! lol And, customarily, I also got a picture with the chef after the service! Go try it out. And, let me know if they keep uni and cream puff or corn bread and caviar in the menu ;)"

        "Joy W.": "After trying Birdbox and learning that they had previously created Birdsong, I was curious to try the tasting menu and we came here for our anniversary. Unknowingly I made a reservation for the chef's table, which is actually the same price as the dining room, $295 per person + 20% service charge, for a '3-hour dining experience,' but it was actually closer to 2 hours. We were led to our seats facing an open kitchen with a lot of dried hanging ingredients, even a dried fish skeleton. The table setting was minimalist with a weighted utensil stand, which I could imagine using at home. We enjoyed a delicious meal all while watching tasty things get cooked on the hearth. Giant Clam - cucumbers, coastal succulents: Good! Very aesthetically pleasing ashtray-looking dish with many (almost too many) slivered cucumbers and meaty clams. There was a bit of an effervescent quality to the broth. Creek-Raised Trout - I don't know what inspired a trout trio. Is there a trout trend I don't know about? 1. Tail end prepared like lox, puffed skin, fresh cheese: Great! Very cheesy ravioli filled with smokey trout. I could eat many of these. 2. Loin cured in cedar, shiso, pine needle condiment: Good! Super simple bite-sized trout topped with radish topped with shiso, which I ate like a mini lettuce wrap 3. Roe, custard made with grilled bones, warmed tomatoes: Great! 4 beautiful cherry tomatoes with a generous serving of trout roe over custard, which tasted a lot like steamed tofu. A mix of sweet, salty, and creaminess. Root Broth - braised wakame, smoked mussels, shrimp: Great! A bowl of what looks like a a lot of wakame seaweed and a tiny bit of broth poured table-side, but dig in and the bowl reveals mussels, shrimp, and vegetables. Black Cod Grilled Over Embers - bouillon of pine needles: Good! Also super simple tender cod with crispy skin on top and half a mushroom soaking up the savory broth. Sea Urchin Cream Puff - fermented shiitake, savory butterscotch: Excellent! I already love uni, but this was even better than I expected. The shiitake is almost meaty, which complements the soft, smooth uni. When I popped this in my mouth and bit down, the butterscotch filling oozed out. It was a very savory, sweet satisfying flavor. Butterscotch, who knew? I didn't know it could be so good. Cornbread & Caviar: Excellent! What arrives is the cornbread in a triangle shaped pan. It was very rich, tastes more like olive oil cake than cornbread. The waiter took his time topping all the caviar and crme frache, making sure to get every little caviar egg onto the cornbread. I'm grateful, because I didn't want to waste a single one. Then he cut the triangle in half and we ate it up. It was so rich and so good with the briny, salty caviar. Since it comes with one cornbread that is cut in half, I wonder how this is served when you have an odd number of people in your party. Squab - lacquered & smoked grilled parker house rolls: Okay! The squab itself had a sweet and savory flavor, but I didn't really care for how it was meant to be a different take on Peking duck wraps. It read more like squab with pickled vegetables, lettuce, with sweet rolls. I preferred eating the squab on its own. The claws were tasty, but kind of cumbersome to eat with my hands. My favorite part was the adorable glass birds. Aged Lamb Loin - chanterelles cooked over the fire: Good! Another meat and mushroom pair. I'm not a big fan of lamb, but this was not very gamey and had tasty flavor Chamomile Sorbet - apples, mint, honey: Good! Very bright and refreshing sorbet. The waiter pours honey from a canister to top off the sorbet. I'm not a big fan of sticky sweet things, and the honey comes out liquid, but upon contact on the cold sorbet, it seized up quickly, so it didn't mesh with the sorbet that well. Gooseberry - citrus marigold, grilled milk: Great! Sweet gooseberries circle the bruled grilled milk, tastes like berries over crme brule. I didn't think the two strawberries on the side made any difference, but I'm happy to have fresh fruit. Chocolate Souffl: Excellent! The last dessert was a celebratory off-menu souffl. I think this is probably the best souffl I have ever had. Chocolatey and not too eggy or soggy at all. There were a few standout dishes, including the cheesy trout ravioli, sea urchin cream puff, cornbread & caviar, and I definitely enjoyed the souffl. However there were some dishes that didn't have much of a wow factor, such as the cod, squab, lamb. At this price point, I was just hoping for a bit more oomph in the menu, but we still enjoyed it and walked away very full after a couple of hours. Service was great and I appreciated the little felt baskets to hold your bag. Their music selection is also pretty good. We left with a hand written card and inside it was a polaroid of us, a lovely memory of the evening."

        "Jane W.": "I came here for my birthday this year and overall had a good experience.  Some of my favorites from their tasting menu included: - Shigoku oysters with chicken fat and cauliflower: extremely flavorful! Yet somehow, the richness did not overpower the oysters. Excellent way to start the meal. - Cornbread, caviar, and walnuts: a generous serving of caviar + walnut spread on warm cornbread. Not a combination I would have imagined but it worked! - Wild axis deer: I am not a big red meat person (this is usually the part of the meal where I start getting full and opt to not finish the red meat course so I can save room for dessert), but this was fantastic and I finished it all! We watched them tend to the meat for almost the entire meal, so I was very excited to try it (and it did not disappoint). Flavorful and tender. - Quail, lacquered and smoked: while not my favorite from a flavor perspective, the presentation and experience of creating your own rolls was very fun and a highlight of the evening. Some of my least favorites included: - Sea urchin cream puff: sounded amazing, but the butterscotch inside the puff overpowered the generous pieces of sea urchin. - Old beef tartare: this was surprisingly bland.  The remaining dishes, including the creek-raised trout, root broth, douglas fir, and milk & persimmons ranged from somewhat forgettable (root broth) to very good (my favorite of those were probably the milk & persimmon vs creek-raised trout). As expected, the service was attentive, professional, and friendly. One of my favorite parts of the experience was sitting at the chef's table, since I got to face the open kitchen.  Overall recommend a visit!"

        "Michael U.": "Having moved from Alinea to Pastry at benu to Atelier Crenn and finally Chef de Cuisine at Saison the next logical step for Chef Christopher Bleidorn was a Restaurant of his own, and since 2018 that has been Birdsong.  Said to emphasize seasonality and whole-Animal cookery, the website offering a wordy manifesto on wisdom and tradition, it is along a sketchy stretch of SoMa that guests will find a scene not unlike the one created by Skenes in terms of design, music and ethos. Priced higher than The French Laundry after auto-grat, prepaid reservations offered on Tock, it is at the Chef's counter or surrounding tables that diners receive ten-courses from servers working in a mostly perfunctory role without much charm or personality. Leaving most of the cooking to Chef de Cuisine Yesenia Castaon, a first-generation immigrant cooking with a passion born on her Grandmother's Mexican Food, Bleidorn watches mostly silent from the pass as Wine is poured and plates arrive, a single Oyster in foamed Fat not particularly delicious while a trio of Trout to follow ate like an essay on nose-to-tail butchery. Now holding 2* Michelin of its own, a bowl of \"Root Broth\" channeling Saison's Brassicas without as much finesse, aged Cod is really where the menu starts to get interesting thanks to taste and complexity before proceeding to a \"Sea Urchin Cream Puff\" that doubles down on Saison's famous Toast by adding umami-laced Butterscotch. Continuing to showcase baking skills with Cornbread & Caviar, a truly spectacular dish that nonetheless begs questions of how it fits Birdsong's \"whole Animal\" concept, smoked Quail comes hot off the hanger with flavorful crackling Skin and condiments to formulate a Sandwich using smoky housemade Bread. Not a place to linger, presumably doing two turns a night, Lamb arrives with a generous Fat-cap and flavors intensified by dry-aging before a duo of Desserts that taste fine but fail to show any sign of either Chef Castaon or Bleidorn's training in Pastry."

Marcella's has the best lasanaga and arguably one of the best carbonaras I've had in the entire city and outside of Italy. Everything was piping hot, individual serving size, PERFECTLY seasoned and PERFECTLY al dente. *chefs kiss* This is such a Dogpatch neighborhood gem that has the mom & pop feel, stays true to their Italian roots, and is just a no frills, good overall restaurant. The owner / servers were so attentive and sweet, you can't help but think about coming back. This place just has you wishing that they were open more days & also for dinner hours. But it suits the lunch vibes, so if you can make it, I highly recommend you check it out during the day!"

They said they would be able to accommodate us so we decided to swing by. Luckily it wasn't too cold as we were seated outdoors.  We ordered pasta, tortellini, 3 different lasagnas, a salad and a glass of wine. The food was delicious and came out quickly. I like how everything is served on it's own pan.  A bit pricey for what it is, but would come back to support this mom and pop shop."

        "Holly H.": "Solid classic Italian food with no frills.  If you want to get their $80 lasagna trays, make sure to place that order in advance to get it hot. If you just walk in, you can get their available trays cold to go.  Ended up getting four different dishes: Abruzzo Lasagna, Bolognese Lasagna, Spaghetti Carbonara, Rigatoni con Pollo. If you have a larger party than 2, it might be hard to get seating (most of the tables are suited for small parties, but I saw a party of 5 crowded around a small table outside). I liked the Abruzzo Lasagna (the flavor of the Italian sausage made it stand out compared to the Bolognese), but my favorite dish was the Rigatoni con Pollo. I usually get sick of white sauce, but something about their white sauce was strangely addictive.  Slightly pricy for what I would usually want to pay for this type and quantity of food ($100.67), but I was also not surprised by the bill since most restaurants in the area have similar high prices."

There's a lot of street parking in the neighborhood. I'll be back soon to eventually eat every lasagna on the menu!"

There's a couple of tables outside and when it's cold, they'll offer blankets. The service was great and the server would crack joke with us.  I got to try a couple of different lasagnas but my favorite was the Bianca. The flavor was so good, you could really taste the onions and garlic. It comes out on a mini pan that's still hot to the touch. There's pancetta too but the pieces are really small. Each order comes with either salad or soup and we also got some free bread for the table.  My only gripe was how little meat there was. I probably would have been even more satisfied if the pancetta were bigger pieces. It's the same across the other lasagnas I tried, while there might be some meat flavor, it'll mostly be the pasta."

        "Candace R.": "Marcella's has been on my list of places to try for a long time but since they're only open for lunch and not near work, it hasn't been until this year that I've been able to try it. I'm currently finishing up my second meal here and it hit the spot, just as I'd hoped.  I started with a single espresso and decided to try the bolognese lasagna this visit. Previously I ordered the abruzzo and just wanted to try something different. Lasagna comes with soup or salad and I opted for the soup which, today was a vegetable soup with broccoli. For a normal appetite, I'd say the portions are perfect. I finished everything without feeling too full and the peroni was perfect to wash everything down. Both times I've been there's just one guy running front of house so if you're in a rush, I'd pick somewhere else but I find the service to be great. Especially considering all of the tables are occupied right now. I've also seen a lot of people come by to pick up catering which I bet is amazing for a large group. Definitely recommend."

        "Andy L.": "Marcella's has the best lasagna I've ever had. The pasta was quite thin so it wasn't too filling and I loved how delicate it felt. The bottom of the lasagna was crusted up nicely to add some extra texture. It was nice that they kept it in a pan as he did in the oven so it stayed warm all the way through the meal. Make sure to ask for extra red purple flakes for an extra bump in flavor. The service was excellent. The owner/waiter/cashier was friendly and accommodating. I feel like this is one of those places that you can recommend to anyone and they'll enjoy the experience."

Everything is done right here- the sauces and flavors are bright, spicy and tasty, yet simultaneously comforting, so you feel like you're at home. Our next round began with a goblet of lychee melon cocktail and other Peruvian specialties, such as the Tacu-Tacu Marisquero, a rice and bean dish with seafood, Anticuchos de pollo, which are chicken skewers, and lomo saltado, a stir-fry dish with beef, onions, and tomatoes.

We ordered the fiesta platter to share, which had Chicharrn de pollo, beef empanadas, yuca fries and platano frito. All of these were strong separately and together. The star of this platter for me was the lime dipping sauce. I put this sauce on everything, and wish I could have bought some to go! The Tacu Lomo was wonderful-the food was so fresh and the rice was crispy but not burned. The rice and the soy sauce were wonderful. What made this and the steak pop was the lime sauce from the fiesta platter.  The quality of the food was outstanding, as was the service. It was hard not to look at other people's tables as well. I wish our time here had been longer, but the night was young and we wanted to explore San Francisco! This was an easy five stars-I would go here again in a heartbeat."

Firstly, this location isn't exactly in the heart of the Mission, so just keep that in mind if you're planning to do other things. The food and drinks were all individually incredible. We ordered what our waiter recommended, and we were not at all disappointed. The flavors were on point and the we understood why so many people come here. However, I will say that the dishes didn't really go well together. My palate was a bit confused eating truffle mac & cheese, ceviche, and a steak--tasted good but didn't really make sense. All of the workers were super friendly and polite. There were a fair amount of families with younger kids, but we did come at around 5pm. The later we stayed the more adult the crowd became. Definitely an good / interesting dining experience."

They have multiple locations in San Francisco, Burlingame, Oakland, Walnut Creek, and Mountain View -- typically I always go to the San Francisco locations -- I do prefer this location on Van Ness because the restaurant is bigger. Their food has always been on point for dinner -- to their:  DINNER: - Lomo Saltado - Empenadas - Chicken w/ their sauces - Fish and Calamari - Sangria - Truffle Mac and Cheese (OG CLASSIC MUST GET ALL THE TIME) - Ceviche Mixto (MY FAVORITE OUT OF ALL OF CEVICHE) BRUNCH: They have a large variety of mimosa flavors such as: - Passion Fruit Orange - Blue Elderflower - Peach thyme - Lychee - Cucumber Lemon - Mango Pineapple - my personal favorite was the passion fruit and peach thyme, but all of them were so fruity and delicious - I loved the blue color of the blue elderflower perfect for pictures! We started off with their new Pan Con Chicharon was another new favorite of mine loved the tenderness and crispness of the pork belly - and their house baked brioche, salsa criolla, & aoili paired perfect w the sweet potato fries The Crispy Pork Belly & Waffles loved the new unique twist on this dish and the pork belly was perfectly crispy and delicious.  Their Oreo Pancakes was simply perfect - pancakes were fluffy and the strawberry, whipped cream, and Oreo with Fig Syrup was the perfect bite!  Next the Frittata had Sauted broccolini, bacon, eggs, Oaxaca & Monterey Jack cheese, house crema was light, but hearty and perfect for brunch!  If you want a healthy, fruity, and refreshing - the Hawaiian Papaya Bowl is perfect - the greek yogurt, granola, chia seeds, raspberry coulis & fresh fruit meshes great together The OG classic the Truffle Mac & Cheese - NO MATTER IF ITS BRUNCH OR DINNER YALL HAVE TO GET THEIR TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE- no explanation needed. For desserts we had the: - Chocolate Bandido - Tres Leches - Panna Cotta ALL SO DELICIOUSLY SWEET - YALL HAVE TO TRY ALL 3!!

        "Amy T.": "Came here for a late lunch with some classmates. The restaurant was very clean with a bar inside with bar stools. - There's a bathroom on the basement floor - basement floor also has additional tables to host parties/events - they are known for their rotisserie chicken --you can smell the aroma of the chicken once you step into the restaurant. - has indoor and outdoor seating! En Las Nubes aka \"in the clouds\" (drink) - 7-day infused pea tequila - was supposed to have cotton candy on it (hence the name in the clouds) however, they ran out of that at the time and the waiter made me something else, to be honest, didn't really need/want cotton candy in my drink so it worked out. - the little baby's breath drink decor was a nice touch parihuela de mariscos (main course) - dubbed Peruvian Cioppino - had a variety of seafood and lots of shrimp - wished it came with rice/bread or some type of carb - the soup was very savory"

I was beyond impressed with the food - we ordered the ceviche mixto (rococo spice level) and it was amazing! Super spicy/tangy and every single bite just had so much flavor. We also go the half rotisserie chicken (SO GOOD) with sweet potato fries (AMAZING) and China Vegetables (would probably get something else next time, this was just zucchini). The service was also great and the dining area is cute and cozy, great for small gatherings or a more intimate date :)"

A kid brought us back to our table and took our drink orders when we were next. We got mimosas, water, and coffee. They only give a small cup of orange juice for our entire table since it is fresh squeezed. When we asked for more, the lady said it is $7 for the small cup (check picture for reference). The glasses they handed out were not cleaned well enough because mine still had a lipstick stain on it. After the drinks were brought to us, we had to flag down a waiter to take our order.  We ordered the waffle special with scrambled eggs, sausage patty and the Armida Scramble (Skillet). The eggs were made perfectly, not over cooked. The sausage patty and waffles were good. The fruit on the waffles were sweet too! The Armida Scramble came with A LOT of tater tots and it's amazing! The food is definitely 5/5! As for the service, one of the ladies bringing out the food was really rude. They were bringing out two of almost every order and when we told the lady that we already got the order and no one else ordered it, she rolled her eyes and got really impatient then walked away. The person taking our order must have entered it wrong.  If the glasses were clean, someone took our order without us flagging them down, and the one lady who brought out the food was kinder, this place would be 5 stars because the food is great!"

My friend and I visited here today and sat at the bar seating. We ordered the chick n egg Benedict, croissant French toast and unlimited coffee. The Benedict was extremely delicious, soft flavourful and a perfect ratio of bun to the fried chicken to the perfectly cooked Benedict. Foodgasmic as described by my friend. The toast was good, should be eaten while it's warm for best taste. The coffee was decent and they kept refilling multiple times. The staff were pretty sweet and kept a close tab on us. Must visit if you are in the area."

        "Sarai L.": "Thinking about the French Toast!  Tiny little restaurant that I am guessing always has a little wait! We were able to get seated right away, but took a bit to get service. Friendly service, but not timely.  The good stuff: French toast! Soooo yummy and flavorful. Cooked to crispy and chewy perfection with some cinnamon apples to top it off! The $11 price tag for 2 pieces is a little steep, but it's worth every bite., The OJ. Freshly juiced in house is worth every drop!! It would have mad a fantastic mimosa (which they have if you choose to opt for it!)  The okay stuff: We both got veggie omelettes with wheat toast. I'll be honest, I'm an omelette girl and these were a bit of a disappointment. The amount of vegetables was GREAT! But overall I think the omelette lacked flavor. If I were to come back I wouldn't get it again.  Long story short: Come by if you have time, get the French toast and OJ, leave happy."

Got there at 11am and the place was busy but there were a few tables open. They sat me even tho the bestie and her bf was running late, which was appreciated. Their mimosa deal was pretty decent - 36 bucks for a bottle of champagne and orange juice. Definitely seems on the less pricey end for brunch. I got the eggs benedict and it comes with 3 eggs benedict!! Typical brunch places only come with 2 so it was stuffed with 3. Their hash browns were crispy and yummy - not greasy at all. The bestie and her bf got the trio benedict and I could hear them saying \"yummmm\" bite after bite. Service was quick. Would come back again if we're ever in the area."

        "Momo C.": "Always passed by here but never tried until now. Got the San Bruno Florentine, Chick n' Egg Benedict and orange juice. Really liked the San Bruno Florentine because the veggies make everything moist and balanced. Orange juice was really refreshing because it is freshly squeezed by their machine. Personally did not like their Chick n' Egg Benedict because the fried chicken patty was very dry and starchy(tasted like a frozen breaded chicken patty they fried/baked) and the gravy did not have much taste to it. It would have been much better if they used freshly fried chicken made from scratch. Got their hash brown as the side and it was very average and nothing to be excited about. Overall was decent because they really did a good job with the poached eggs and their guy server was very nice and attentive. Not a place I would purposely drive out to dine in."

It was hard rationing the hummus between the pita and shawarma. It's hard to find such a filling meal for such a good deal in the city these days! - Moussaka: Warm and perfectly tangy from the tomatoes. Even if you're not much of an eggplant person like I am, you might still enjoy this dish! Would definitely return to try the other mezze options on the menu."

The shanklish, hummus with beef, tabbouli, grilled halloum, and kafta were our favorites! The chicken shawarma, batata harra were good but not exceptional. The knefe was extra oily/buttery. The 2 downsides: service was good until half way there and then we waited a very long time for our items. They also did not have a single high chair for our toddler, so I would consider that if you have a young one. Staff was friendly otherwise and prices were very competitive compared to other SF spots!"

They also give you pita bread too. The chicken is moist and flavorful which pairs well with the rice. It's usually enough for 2 meals for me!  I will say I've noticed that I end up with variations of the chicken shawarma plate. Something's a bit different every time, but I never mind because the food is always good.  I always notice the same guy when I come to pick up food so it might be a family business. I'll happily continue to support a local restaurant with delicious food!!"

EVERYTHING, every single thing we got was a flavor explosion. Everything was perfectly seasoned. Everything came nicely packaged and neatly presented. I cant speak to authenticity, but I what i can say is that you can tell that the owners have put a lot of love into their food. I am now going to be a loyal regular."

Pretty small shop with a few employees, but those I talked to were so nice and knowledgeable of each of their pastries so it was a nice experience. I got a few pastries to go but loved their kitschy vibe. The spinach and feta boureka surprised me as I'm not partial to feta, but it was a well-balanced savory pastry. The pistachio creme puff was underwhelming as the pastry itself was dry and the inside cream and outside layer of chocolate were wet... definitely needed a sip of water after this.

It was rich and dense, and not too sweet. The earl grey glaze on top was also delicious, and flavors paired together nicely. Tea was good too, but I guess it's hard to go wrong with tea.  It was very busy, and we waited a bit in line and for a seat, but it was quite nice once we sat down. The cashier was nice and accommodating to my allergies!"

I thought the tart was good, but the boureka was just cold and dry, so kind of sad. I liked that the tea came with a teapot!  The place was super hectic and busy the whole time I was there (Sunday 10:30am-12pm) so getting a table was almost impossible. You really have to wait in a crowd for a table to open up, so seems like a risky place to grab coffee or catch up. I probably wouldn't come back soon unless someone really wanted to try it!"

It's pretty offensive, but for once I understand why people catcall. When you see perfection, you have to call it out. Every pastry is masterfully done, the perfect balance of sweetness, like a flirtatious smile that lasts just the right amount of time. You get a little square of halva with coffee or tea. It's a delicious surprise that leaves you wanting more. Will that halva text me back later? I hope so. I anxiously watch my phone. Take a babka to a fancy brunch to impress hard-to-impress people! Just one slice and they'll all keep reliving it that night as they toss and turn with desire. I sure did.

We initially wanted to go to a different place but it happened to be closed to we yelped Chinese food near by and Rong's came up. We came on a weekday around noon and there was no wait. The guy working there was super nice. We ordered:  1. Pork Belly: One of the best pork belly I've ever had. The fat melts in your mouth and is full of flavor. It had such an authentic, Sichuan flavor that reminded me of my grandmas cooking. The portion size was very fair for the price. I also normally don't like quail eggs but it was so delicious. Highly recommend! (also their menu is kind of confusing where it was crossed off and looked like they sold out but it's actually still in stock and ask them if they still have it)  2. Sweet and Sour Ribs: almost as good as the pork belly! The ribs were so soft and fell off the bone. The sauce was thick and rich.  3. Fried rice: So flavorful but not too salty. Went really well with the saucy meat dishes. Great Wok flavor as well  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall, definitely will be back! I feel like this location should be talked about more for their amazing food! I never heard of it other than randomly finding it on yelp!

        "Lee D.": "FYI - No bathrooms. They recommend going to the neighboring businesses to use theirs... According to them, SF passed a law where customers are NOT allowed to walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom. The bad news is that more than half my guests are older, and I mean OLDER, and they need to use the bathrooms often! So for the first half an hour of our meal, they were all lecturing me on why I chose this place. So thankful I sat at the very end of the long table. Quality/Quantity - Overall the food was good and made fresh to order. They only do 1 dish at a time and they did it in the order I ordered. I/we would have preferred the fried rice and flat noodles earlier, but I didn't and should have also said something. After a few dishes came out, I asked if they could bring out the white rice now. We also had the option to adjust the spiciness of the dishes.  Sea Bass Tofu Soup with Cilantro - Good start of the meal, a hit for all. Well done. Two orders of \"Lion-Head\" Meatball - This was also a hit with all. For a large group like ours, we would have preferred smaller and more meatballs versus 2 huge ones that we cut into smaller pieces. Three Flavored Duck - This was another hit; interesting and good flavors, can't really describe it. Plus we got a lean meaty duck. :) Stir Fried Beef with Onion - I thought the beef was tough, but the veggies were fresh. Sweet & Sour Pork Spare Ribs - My daughter's favorite. Not your typical sweet & sour sauce. Kung Pao Chicken - Similar flavor as other kung pao chickens, but the veggies (zucchinis) were very fresh. Chicken Fried Rice - Okay, good flavors. Homemade Homemade Pan Fried Flat Noodle - Different, but good. I really enjoyed the sear and crispiness of the noodles. The gravy was good also. The below group of dishes seemed to have the same \"base\" sauce, ingredients, flavors, etc. Two orders of Chicken Wings - Good, but I was just too full when the second order finally came out. Sichuan Spicy Chicken - One of my favorite dishes. But of course it was deep fried with a slight kick. String Beans - The vegetable of the day, came with an option of ground pork, but we had one vegan guest, so we held off on the meat on this dish. Fish Fillet in Hot Chili Sauce - This was very bean sprout forward. Atmosphere - Small local business. Open 6 days a week from 11am or 11:30 am to 8:30pm; closed Mondays. Yelp hours differ slightly from the posted signs, see picture. Street parking, got lucky on this rainy day and parked right in front. Also today is Sunday, so free metered parking. Service - Okay. The one volunteer (boyfriend of the owner) working the front end seemed overwhelmed and backed up; not even sure if he has restaurant experience...? We were a large group, and there was only 1 other table which arrived later. They also had a few take out orders, I think 3...? Seemed like the kitchen had only 1 burner on, because one dish came out at a time. We asked if they could just leave a pitcher of tea or hot water out so we could just help ourselves. The good news is that he got us everything we asked for, but we did have to ask for it. Price - $277 + tip. Owner Comment - Congrats on your success since 2017; wishing you the best. Overall the food was good, but sadly due to no bathrooms, we will likely not be back."

Even though it underwent a name change since then, it looked like most of the menu remained the same, so I made plans to catch dinner there one night. Since this was an area of the city I had not yet explored, I decided to check this place out a little early in the evening then do some exploring, so off we went.  Rong's is not large, and looking at their setup they can accommodate both sit-down diners and takeout. Decor is simple and straightforward - somewhat neutral colors but they do have touches of color and plants throughout the space; the windows out front bring in a lot of light to brighten the space. When we arrived it was not crowded at all, so we took a table close to the window and started to browse the menu.  The menu has a variety of vegetable and meat dishes, as well as a selection of apps and a variety of teas to choose from. Tea sounded great, so I went with their high mountain milk tea. It was quite good - I ordered it at 50% sweetness with boba and it was the perfect complement to the food. We started with the pan fried dumplings which had great flavor. For my main I decided on the pineapple chicken; the dish was good - it had a good balance of sweet and savory with a good amount of chicken and pineapple. Bell peppers and onion rounded out the dish and cut through the sweetness of the pineapple and sauce.  Service was good, there was a slight hiccup when our mains didn't come out at the same time - that's one of my pet peeves but our sever was friendly which somewhat made up for it. Overall, I thought Rong's served some solid food. I wouldn't necessarily call this a destination eatery in SF, but if you're in the area it's worth a stop in."

Their menu is quite short, but their dishes are classics Suzhou/Shanghainese. We ordered the fish tofu soup which was light and delicious. We also got the salted meat fried rice and braised pork belly with quail eggs- both were quite authentic. We tried the spicy boiling fish and spicy chicken- these were Szechuan dishes but also made quite well. My favorite was the fried rice! Their tea/boba was pretty good too. One person in our group even ordered seconds. Would definitely come here again to try their "

        "Xinyu L.": "This restaurant features Suzhou cuisine, which is sometimes described as just a little on the sweet side of the Chinese food scale.  We ordered the Peppery Chicken & Pork Tripe Soup (). It had a hard hitting, sharp type of spice from the white pepper and ginger. The tripe gave it a distinct flavor. Not a dish for everyone but we are adventurous eaters.  We also got the Delicious Braised Pork Belly (), which is a classic dish from this region. The pork belly was well prepared and melts in your mouth. The quail eggs were a good addition and added a creamy element."

All the retired folks have to cook their own meals now. You won't recognize it! It's been renovated, from top to bottom. Ramens to dumplings now! Pan fried pork bun were so soft, and the pork flavorful like Lop cheung. Wonton broth was clear and the won tons seemed to be made from pork. The vegetable was pieces of lettuce. I like the red vinegar. You'll get a small container of pickled daikon. Tonkotsu looked authentic! My friend really like the Cha-siu.

        "Doreen C.": "Came here for brunch on Sunday for 2 and there was no wait. The waiter seated us immediately and was super nice! We originally came here cause I thought it looked interesting - it looked like it would be a Hong Kong style restaurant (as it served dim sum, and judging by its name), but it served ramen so thought it would be an interesting experience. We ordered the vegan ramen, Dandan noodles, and shengjianbao. Everything was decently good, but I wouldn't say there was anything particularly special. The ramen was just typical Japanese style ramen.  I think for what it is, this place is kinda pricey ($17 for a bowl of ramen, $9 for 4 buns). I think if it were cheaper I would've given it 5 stars. But overall still decent food but nothing special about this place that would draw me back again unless I was around the area"

        "Ed U.": "It really doesn't feel that long ago when this space was the vintage Manor Coffee Shop with the tireless waitresses in their pink uniforms. However, ownership has turned over at least three times since those golden days with the last one a pho house and the latest an intriguing hybrid of a ramen and dim sum spot with big plans for menu expansion according to the new owner Kevin. Kevin is not Japanese, but he is a big fan of ramen and Japanese food in general. His personal background explains the Cantonese restaurant name. It also explains why the ramen on the menu is referred to as 'min'. I decided to get off the M line in West Portal to give it a try. I ordered their top ticket item, the $23 Brisket King Min, which he offered with the option of flat rice noodles. I went for it, and the bowl was filling and delicious. It had plenty of beef brisket in beef bone broth, menma, kikurage, green onion, a seasoned soft-boiled egg, and loads of rice noodles absorbing the broth (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3X6mxMR&s=dad8e8d2f38f508567bf7dcec63ac621c46c6b56dacca1df457db9bd5322a5a7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3X6mxMR</a>).

        "Tracy K.": "I found this spot on Yelp because it had vegan options. Talked to the waiter and he said I could get the creamy vegan ramen, spinach & mushroom dumplings, and the scallion pancakes. The vegan ramen broth was bland and I was not a fan of most of the veggies that were in there. They need more work on perfecting their vegan ramen broth. Luckily they had the red flakes spice to give it some more flavor. The dumplings were okay. I was surprised to see the scallion pancakes deep fried. First time having it and it tastes pretty good, but extremely oily. It tastes like a you tiao/yau Zai guay. My non vegan family had the brisket king and the tonkotsku chashu. My family thought the broth had good flavor, but the ramen is too less. They were really generous with the meat, but not with the veggies in the vegan ramen though which may be the reason why it tastes bland. The ambiance was quiet. Parking is street parking and metered parking. We did not have any trouble finding any parking on a Saturday afternoon."

The spice level for my Tan Tan had the right amount of spice, you taste the spice but it doesn't over power the dish. The brisket that my husband had was super tender, falling over as he picked it up with his chopsticks. The Tonkotsu broth was tasty and satisfying. We also ordered Man Tau which is fried bun served with condensed milk for dipping the man tau. Oh the crunch and chewy sweetness!  We will definitely be coming back! Only my husband got a pic of his dish; we dove right into ours. Can't wait to try other dishes on the menu."

The menu looks delicious, but my friend and I were a bit let down with what we ordered. We weren't big fans of the chicken wing. It's a curious fusion of chicken, orange dressing, and the filling of an egg roll. I wouldn't recommend it, especially since it's $9 for just one. The shrimp salad was just ok, it was a bunch of flavors put together but ultimately felt a bit flavorless.  The pork belly was great though and I highly recommend this dish! Flavorful and a fair portion of meat.  I wish I ordered the right things, a bit disappointed!"

Giant portion as it is an entire fish so would share next time for 2-3 people minimum if there are other dishes. Green Curry: creamy and good amount of seafood! Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Rice does not come with the dishes so you do have to order either plain white rice or jewelry rice.

We asked the server what was most popular and she basically said everything is, and I would agree that everything we had was mostly the same level of deliciousness. - crying tiger shrimp salad - Thai-inspired flavors - chilled Dungeness crab salad - also Thai-inspired, the crab was so tender - chicken wing - we each got half a wing to share but I wish I got my own, it was nice and crispy with good sauce - Gracie Creek ribeye - so tender and the server explained it as tasting like pho when eaten with the herbs/veggies and it was very true - pork belly - so flavorful, did have a bone - grilled oyster mushrooms - I don't love mushrooms but I liked this - scallion buns - this was the least favorite dish for most of us, but maybe because we waited too long to eat it and it got cold and the pork belly and ribeye just had better flavor in comparison - jewelry rice - a plainer flavor compared to everything else but had interesting texture and good for sopping up sauce/curry - green curry - more like a soup but it was tasty Dessert - halo ha-lao - my favorite, not your typical halo halo. I liked the sorbet and other textural elements - ginger cake - I don't love ginger but pretty good if you do - pandan bibingka - like a mochi cake, this was my second favorite dessert"

        "Cynthia L.": "We arrived @ 11pm, slightly hungry after our earlier dinner at 5pm. Had to wait about 45min to get seated though. After being allowed inside, I was surprised to see that the restaurant itself was just as small as that door--there were only about 5-6 tables in a very vertically oriented, rectangular room.I didn't mind this as it reminded me of those tiny mom&pop restaurants in Japan. The intimate ambiance and setting was emphasized by the drapes and lights that lit up the red room. It was a maximalist's dream (and minimalist's nightmare)--so many small knick knacks lined up on the walls and cute drawings! The music choice was also really interesting , they played bangers from Indian, Spanish, Korean, and even Cantonese music!  Now, onto the food! Since we had an earlier dinner, we decided to order a few dishes: the duck meat yakitori, the scallop shots, toro sampler, and Mount Fuji dessert. I forget the actual names of the dishes. I will say that all of the items on the menu are at a higher price point for a really tiny portion so do be ready for your wallet to hurt and leave slightly hungry haha. However, I thoroughly enjoyed every single dish to the max. I cannot stress this enough--everything was thought out so well and made with intention. As someone who is usually not a big fan of thick cuts of meat, I kept my expectations for the duck meat yakitori low. However I was blown away by how well cooked it was, the light taste of a tiny char on the meat was delicious and it was juicy and a mouthful! It also came with this sort of yuzu? Marmalade dipping sauce and it was paired SO well with the meat. It cut out the gaminess for me which is a big factor of why I usually dislike / get tired of eating meat. My only complaint is that the soy glaze was a bit saltier than I would have liked but due to everything else being amazing, I'd still give this 5/5. The scallop shots were so amazing as well. It came with some tobiko, ponzu, and yuzu. Two spoons of this was NOT enough for me! I would eat 20 spoons if I could. I kid you not the flavors were so fresh and complimented each other so so well. Again, I delineate that I feel what Chome does so well is having flavor balance and different textures, acidities, and tastes to compliment each other, creating a final delicious dish. It's almost a crime that everything is in such tiny portions! 5/5 The toro sampler was also delicious, it came sizzling hot in a small cast iron pan. The meat was high quality and marbled nicely, and I loved the edition of the krispy rice in the slightly sweet and sour soy sauce which added a unique texture to the dish. Again, I appreciated the layers to this dish because sometimes with sashimi and other mushier foods , I get consistency issues. But the addition of this crispy rice and the sweet acidity of the sauce paired so well with the soft, buttery mouthfeel of the toro! This was the first dish I received and me and my bf both took a bite and widened our eyes at each other so you know it's good. Actually scratch that because we did that for every dish here so everything was really good!! 5/5 Now on to the dessert..the Mount Fuji dessert was the perfect ending to my night. This is downright ridiculously good to me because I hate overly sweet desserts. If you are someone who enjoys light, refreshing desserts, this is for you. The matcha panna cotta was silky and unsweetened which I loved. The matcha ice cream was perfectly sweet and also came with matcha ice cream Mochi cubes--I had no idea how they made this because it was like ice cream on the outside and Mochi on the inside. Again with the complexity that I adored! It also came with some fresh berries and other fruits and the highlight-- candies beans. Yes, candied beans!! They looked like mung bean or red beans and they had a lightly dusted sugary coating over it. The beans were an interesting texture--not hard but not mushy. I loved it with everything else. I would get this dessert every day if I could. 5/5 Okay so clearly this place has captured my heart and stomach and I would give it a 6/5 if that were possible. Do remember though that this place has tiny tiny microscopic portions with a heftier price tag so if you're looking for somewhere to grub, this is NOT the place for you (unless of course your wallet is willing!). Do come to Chome if you want to experience fresh ingredients, have your tastebuds be teased by complex, yet clean and simple flavors, and leave satisfied, but also wanting more. I really appreciated how Chome highlights the main ingredient with other flavors but it never doesn't make sense or take away from the dish. It never steals the spotlight of the main ingredient; it only accentuates it.  All in all, if you've read this far on my rambles, tdlr: Chome is truly amazing and is now my favorite Japanese spot in the city! P.S. Excuse the lack of pictures of the actual foods; I was too busy stuffing it in my mouth to remember to snap a pic before!"

        "Max F.": "My girlfriend and I were out in the city celebrating our anniversary. We'd initially had a reservation at a Japanese spot in Oakland, but decided to cancel it in favor of a place we'd visited on one of our first dates. However once we'd arrived at the location, it was inexplicably closed for the night, and so - at 9PM on a Saturday night in SF - we started poking around for a place to eat that was celebration-worthy, and happened upon the listing for Chome. And I honestly could not be happier that our first two dinner plans fell through. We arrived at the restaurant just before 9:30 and found street parking around the corner - We weren't able to join the waitlist over the phone, so we put our name in, and hung out outside for probably 20 minutes before being seated. Judy came out regularly to give us updates on the wait, which I appreciated tremendously!  Everything about the restaurant took me right back to the St. Marks vibes I was so used to in New York - from the spunky and fun interior, to the casual and cozy atmosphere, to the absolutely outstanding food. The dining area is small, with only 5 or 6 tables, but there was just enough room between them that I didn't feel even remotely cramped. We had a great time looking at all the hand-drawn signage that seemed to give the restaurant some self-awareness - I particularly remember the one poking fun at the table that had the column behind it, and the one that kept a tally of the number of dislikes on Yelp.  Over the course of an hour and a half or so, I had a couple of beers and my girlfriend ordered the Yuzu Dream cocktail. Cocktails are very hit or miss with her (usually miss), and I was actually surprised when she downed it and ordered a second one! We were served the complimentary potato salad (which was unexpectedly fantastic!), and we ordered the Combo 7 Skewers and two pieces of the NYC Big Mac roll (because the Yelp photo album was plastered with them) to start. In short, I was sold on the food out the gate. We also ordered the Volcano Bubble Roll after seeing the table next to us get one, the Chu-Toro Sizzler, the Salty Yolky Salmon Skin, and two skewers of the Unagi special. Unagi is always one of my go-to's at Japanese restaurants, but I think these skewers might actually be the best I've had it! For dessert I had the Chocolate Mount Doom and my girlfriend had the Fun Fun Fuji Mountain - We'd told Judy previously that we were celebrating, and both came out with candles and she plopped fun little glowstick rings on our heads.  All in all, truly a fantastic experience. As Judy very correctly put it - nothing there sucks. My girlfriend and I were discussing on the ride home how this was without a doubt our new favorite Japanese spot in the bay - A thousand thanks to Judy and everyone at Chome for giving us such an incredible anniversary dinner!"

The food ranges from excellent to mediocre depending on what you order. Our favorites were the Hokkaido scallops, dumplings, toro sizzlers. I don't recommend getting the 7 skewers. It's not worth $40. Get the portobello skewers on its own. We got mount doom for dessert and it didn't disappoint.  The cocktails had no alcohol whatsoever.  This place is worth trying, but avoid the combo skewers and cocktails."

But the decor is so cute and very Japanese. Perfect for date night or with catch up with a close friend.  Wait - they don't do reservations.got there 5:05 on Wednesday and was able to seat at the last table for 2 which was lucky. I've been here a few times where there was too long of a line to wait. They have a waitlist sign up sheet on paper and you can say the estimated time you'll come back.  Happy hour - take advantage of the happy hour! On weekdays it's 5-5:30pm and they have skewers for good prices and some drinks available including pineapple beer with real pineapple.  Food - Incredibly creative menu and very fun to experiment with ingredients that you wouldn't imagine to go together. For example, the ocean creme brle has the sweet crust that you get from the dessert creme brle but it's consisted of mostly eggs and fish roes. The udon was also delicious and so fulfilling the udon kimchi bacon and duck were great combination.  Price - depending on what you order it can be expensive but I believe it's worth the splurge. However you can probably get full by ordering a lot of items from the happy hour menu like skewers."

Their menu is pretty extensive, lots of options for sushi, main dishes, apps, and skewers.  The omurice was really good, it's a very thin layer of egg rather than the large round one that is soft in the middle which I was expecting but still really good! The Big Mac was good, I felt like you could still taste the individual elements even if you ate it all at once. Definitely just something to try one time lol. The carbonara was also made perfectly, love it with udon noodles. Would definitely order the tuna again, that was probably my favorite.

My friends and I arrived around 4:50pm and stood outside before the opening at 5pm, and by 5pm there was already a complete line waiting outside. Luckily we were able to get a seat but I'd say there's only room for ~15 people in the restaurant, so if you're not within the first crowd I can assume the wait is 30-45 minutes or more.  They started by offering everyone complementary potato salad. I'm not a big fan of mayonnaise but it was still delicious and I ended up eating the whole thing! We ordered a variety of dishes during the happy hour from 5-5:30pm and afterwards, just to get a taste of as many things as possible. They ended with complementary grape and papaya. The papaya was so good my friend and I bought papayas after! The chotoro sizzler was a table favorite. The fish was so fresh and tender, and the ingredients in the \"sizzle\" were delightfully crunchy. The calamari was chewy and lightly breaded, different from the typical oil-heavy fried calamari I'm used to getting. The gizzard skewer was a bit too tough for my liking. I would HIGHLY recommend the Momo duck, which was the highlight for me. The duck was delicious and the orange plum glaze was just the right balance of sweet and tart. Overall I would definitely come back again but I would again arrive before they open to get a spot without a long wait! The food was delightful, but because their menu (or at least the items I ordered) is more fried, I wouldn't wait in a long line for it."

From what I saw, there were probably only 2 people working, and the server was pretty busy the whole time, but she was still nice and let us order happy hour items a little after 5:30 since she was too busy to take our order before then. We ordered the chicken thigh, wing, trumpet mushroom, pork cheek, and salted egg kabocha. I think my favorite were the pork cheek (super chewy and savory) and the kabocha, but everything was scrumptious!!"

It's seriously one of the best dishes in the city."

        "Ed U.": "So I have to admit I was confused by this place, and it's only been open for a month so. I don't think I was hallucinating when I saw chicken rice not only in their menu but in their original name. I had thought they were keeping Rooster & Rice's khao mun gai as a carryover menu item, but I didn't see it right away. I asked the server if they had it but got smallmouth. Flustered, I ordered the $14.95 Mr. Hen (Grilled). It was gratefully a thigh but sadly overcooked. The signature garlic rice wasn't that unique, and the sweet & sour sauce was just plain unnecessary. The cucumber slices were the only item I didn't have a quibble about (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3ItrZ6B&s=abe1894a57f58b4c799ac2195dcc34efcd1c9cee76f50316a6849aa3712bf6b2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3ItrZ6B</a>). I later looked at the menu again and saw that the dollar-cheaper Mr. Hen Classic (Stewed) might've been the one I should've ordered. With misplaced confidence, I returned a couple of weeks later. I was ready to utter the words \"Classic...Stewed\". When I saw the menu, the choice was gone, and the entire menu looked revamped with chicken rice minimized and noodle dishes front and center. Flabbergasted, I asked where the Stewed option was, and the server simply smiled while shaking her head. I was ready to leave but decided I'd try the $14.95 Dry Noodles Grilled. It was better than my first meal but only marginally so. It consisted of a large grilled chicken thigh on top of a bowl of egg noodles mixed in their house sauce. There were bean sprouts, baby bok choy, and green onion to add texture and a healthy component. The broth in the side was oddly cold (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3Y27Vhe&s=844e98f69f1e05a647d699974b1e6b8a276b621531a9e766de59e9ed368ca13d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3Y27Vhe</a>). I have to say a third visit might be a while at least until they've settled on their final menu. Hopefully they'll get the time to improve. Besides, Gai Chicken Rice isn't that far away. FOOD - 3 stars...the grilled chicken was plentiful but overcooked - and what happened to the poached poultry? AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...maintained the same space as Rooster & Rice with a few artistic touches like Mr. Hen on the wall SERVICE - 3.5 stars...smallmouth TOTAL - 3 stars...is Mr. Hen binary challenged?

My noodles with broth and chicken were packed with flavor and texture. Loved the crunch on the moist and tender chicken. Dining room is clean and cute. Counter folks were nice. Prices are the standard for this type of place. I did in person dining and the customers around me seemed happy as well. No pictures because fried chicken makes me into a greedy impatient monster."

The egg noodles were overcooked and clumped together. When I tried to do a noodle pull, the noodles broke apart. Wasn't a fan of the house special sauce either; it's like hoisin so this tasted more like a dry ph g with egg noodles.  It did taste better after adding a liberal amount of lime juice (from home) and the chili sauce.  * #11 Mr.Hen Classic w/ chicken breast, thigh, ginger chicken rice, cucumber, cilantro, mr.hen sauce, side broth ($13.95): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F3vaxkmaj&s=71718cb76abfbd4bcf087d8c0dd914eb110ff534b57cbf7de6ee5f178975714a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/3vaxkmaj</a> *** Add extra chicken thigh ($3.50) *** Add ginger scallion sauce ($1)  With the extra protein, the khao man gai is easily enough for two meals.  --Chicken breast: On the tough and chewy side.

A tad on the saltier side. --Mr.Hen sauce: Salty, tangy, and umami; I believe it's a fermented soy bean and soy sauce based? --Ginger scallion sauce: Fragrant and delicious...in general, I could eat this with rice all day, everyday. A M B I A N C E I've eaten here when it was Rooster & Rice and I'm assuming they've kept the minimalist and casual space with 8-9 tables.  P A R K I N G Difficult street parking like most parts of the city so more of a neighborhood joint.  Overall, bomb chicken karaage! I think the dry noodles and KMG needs improvement but it's only week one so they have lots of potential. 3.5 stars rounded up for a new local small business."

        "Christian C.": "Man, this weather sure has dialed in my go-to as soupy noodles and this place did not disappoint. Glad to see it took over the Rooster and Rice place. No offense, but khao mun gai isn't exactly my fav dish plus we already have a place that specializes in that dish in the neighborhood right across the street from me (Gai). I wasn't sure what to expect as the menu has a bit of a pan-asian vibe going on and that can go really wrong really fast, but I rolled the dice and ordered the khao soi. This one came with tender strips of NY steak on top. Usually I've had this dish with chicken but I actually think I like it better with beef! The broth was tasty and comforting, there was just the right amount of greens, and the noodles were tender and delicious. I can't wait to go back and try some more things there. If they are as good as this, then I will definitely be a regular."

The service was fast and friendly and I loved seeing them make the biscuits on the charcoal grill. The inside was really nice and am excited to dine in one day. The biscuits were not like the southern ones here in the states, but more akin if you took the best parts of those biscuits and scones and put them together. And I didn't think the black pepper would work but it totally made them pop. The cookie was honestly one of the best I've ever had. Will be getting them and the biscuits again! The coffee was just ok, great if you're in the area and want a coffee and a cookie. I'm really looking forward to trying them again for lunch (just started doing) and eventually dinner.

Soft opening last month is SPQR's all day caf. SPQR is Cal-Italin resto that's received a Michelin star for 10 years in a row (since 2012), though they lost it last year. They're currently serving breakfast and lunch (rolled out last week) with dinner service to come. They have indoor and dog-friendly outdoor seating. No umbrellas or heat lamps. Is it fast-casual or full-service?  I visited for lunch and I was confused so I hope communication improves.  M E N U * Breakfast: Scones, charcoal biscuit and biscuit sandwiches, and cookies. * Lunch (dinner service to come): Apps, salads, housemade pastas, entrees (from charcoal grill), sides, and desserts (softs serve). * Drinks: Coffee and wine.  F O O D * Tagliatelle w/ marsala mushrooms & truffle cheese ($28): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fmwmbj7z2&s=b51d941e284742a461fddb88cc82082342a496af510da068e6d3006baa30520f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/mwmbj7z2</a> It's been a hot minute since I've visited SPQR. I loved their pastas so skipped the grilled meat for carbs. My fav part of the dish were the meaty and earthy mushrooms draped with ribbons of nutty + salty truffle cheese. The housemade tagliatelle was overcooked for my preference. The sauce was like a creamy mushroom bisque. While tasty, I was hoping for more tamarind-like tang from the marsala.  * Miso Butterscotch Cookie ($4.25): <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fyckpxkyb&s=dca207bf7a324e2a89e1c340fdb55eda4db24b3765d49de5097dd2ca0e0f7ce2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tinyurl.com/yckpxkyb</a> Deliciously buttery and crispy edges and a chewy center. The miso added a unique savory flavor to balance the sweetness of the butterscotch and chocolate chips.  S E R V I C E Cordial and prompt. Room for improvement: Staff didn't ask if it was for \"here\" or \"to-go\" and assumed the latter. After paying, I asked where I could grab utensils and that's when they asked if it was for \"here\" and brought me utensils, plate, and a napkin. A M B I A N C E Casual bistro caf seating in front with a more formal seating in back for date night. Counter seating so you can oversee the action on the open kitchen. It was quiet for lunch with just a couple of customers...for now. P A R K I N G Difficult street parking.

I LOVE SPQR's donuts so I was very excited, but I thought the biscuit was just ok. It comes prepared with the butter and jam spread on the biscuit, like a sandwich, with the butter on the bottom and the jam on the top. The butter itself was great. I would prefer to apply the amount of butter and jam myself, and keep the biscuit crispy if I want to eat the other half later. Lunch menu looks good and I'd be interested in coming back.

He said I wasn't loyal to one bakery since I visit various bakeries. Mattina, welcome to the neighborhood! There is definitely room for as many good bakeries as possible in each neighborhood. The more pastries the better! This is a lovely, airy space, with a few seats outside, tables near the entrance and a banquette on the right. I was warmly greeted by the counterperson, who explained the different pastry options. I had seen photos of the biscuit on Instagram, and chose it without prosciutto, as a vegetarian. With egg and cheese, it is a great light lunch. The biscuit is well baked, and very good. I also tried the black garlic and cheddar scone, and miso butterscotch cookie. The scone is perfectly balanced in flavor; the cookie, sweet and savory, is outstanding. I look forward to the expanded menu which will be coming soon.

We got the 7-piece board with bacons, sausage, scrambled eggs, yogurt, beet sauce, bread and cauliflower, as well as a trout bowl. The board was quite tasty, although the cauliflower and the beet spread could be a little more flavorful. The trout bowl was delicious but it could be a little bigger. When I think of bowls I tend to think of something that has grains, but this one doesn't and I left feeling a little hungry.

Delicious, super fresh and unique brunch spot. My friend and I tried practically everything, but my favorites were the Hot Smoked Trout Bowl, sprouted rye bread with butter and cinnamon knot.  I was so torn between a 4 and a 5 star but I'm knocking off one star for the price. Agree with other reviews, the prices are REALLY high- and I'm used to paying Sf brunch prices. My trout bowl (that was very very small), a yogurt bowl and a latte was somehow $40. The choose 5 deal seems to be a much better value, but a little sad there's no option to get some of the menu items in it. Lastly I was a little sad my iced latte came out with all the ice already completely melted :( for a $6 latte that felt off.

It has porridge baked into it, so it's soft and moist! It's a pretty thick slice of bread, so it's pretty filling. Would recommend! -Runny egg with Spinach Cream: The egg was warm and perfectly runny! The spinach sauce was also tasty. -Yogurt with Granola & Mixed Berry Jam: This was one of my favorites! The mixed berry paired well with the yogurt. -Beetroot Hummus: This is a super bright hummus (great for photos)! It paired well with the sourdough bread. -Lentils w/ Tomato: These were pretty good, though could have had a bit more flavor. Overall, the food is very healthy, unique, and aesthetic!

My friend got the smoked trout bowl and that was by far my favorite dish, the creme fraische with the pickled red onions combo with everything was great. Smaller than we thought. I unfortunately didn't like my order as much, the savory porridge was bland in my opinion and I needed a lil salt.

If you like almond croissants, you have to give this a try. The filling was some of the best I've had. The lamination was perfect, and the poppyseed top was really interesting and went really well. I also thought I tasted something else, some sort of spice that added another layer of umami to the flavor, not sure if it was anise or something else? But def the most complexly delicious flavored croissant I've had. We also had the savory porridge and a choose your own 5 items breakfast. Everything tasted wonderful.

Immediately there's a sense of coziness (unless of course you're on the weekend busy brunch crunch time).  Got to come here on a quiet Tuesday morning and ordered the Lavendel Kaffe and Breakfast Board (5 items).  My breakfast board consisted of: 1. Danish sprouted rye bread 2. Runny organic egg, creamy spinach 3. Curried Pickled Herring 4. Beet Hummus 5. Citrus Salad Note that the breakfast board changes daily so certain items might not be available when you come. And you can get either 5 or 7 items. Like everyone else on Yelp I have to say the beet hummus was really delightful. Flavors for the hummus were subtle and it was lighter than the usual hummus. Flavor wise I really enjoyed the citrus salad. It was sweet and tangy and I could see it pairing well in a dessert or something more savory.  The lavendel kaffe came in a small cup (probably a little larger than an espresso cup). It wasn't too sweet though now that I'm writing this review I'm not sure how much lavender was present.  If you're able to come on the weekday, I highly advise to come M-F. If you're coming on Sat/Sun just be warned that there might be a large crowd for brunch."

I got a latte and a plsehorn, a fancy pig in a blanket.  The plsehorn was great. The sausage was beefy. The pastry was flaky and so buttery. The outside was coated with seeds. I wish they warmed it before serving though.  The latte was okay. I think there are better coffee options around the area. Because it was so busy, it took them a long time to make. I would've been done with my plsehorn if I hadn't waited to eat it.  It was a little chaotic the Saturday I went because it's so crowded. There might not be seats by the time you order. If you come with someone, make sure that one person scouts for seats while the other person orders.  I'd come back for either a light snack or for brunch to try the other items."

Our server was friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive.  The food itself was fantastic.

Hey, all the more reason to come back. The pork belly and beef brisket were also favorites of mine. We end up getting multiple orders. The spicy sauces and seasoning provided added just the right amount of flavor. The portions were generous, and we felt satisfied but not overly stuffed.  The drinks menu was impressive, with a great selection of cocktails and other alcoholic beverages. We tried a few different options and were not disappointed.  Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Korean-style bbq that has excellent food, attentive service, and an inviting atmosphere. We will be back!"

        "Thiri T.": "$40 for AYCE, and definitely a solid spot! The meat quality was very good and fresh. My favorite was the marinated short ribs and the bacon wrapped enoki. Their veggies also were fresh, and the onion and garlic paired well with the grilled meats.  The sides were yummy as well! I liked the bean sprouts, kimchi, fish cake, and the cheese corn that you could top every bite of meat with.  Overall a pretty solid spot! I wasn't super duper mindblown, but the service definitely stands out as one of the best places. Even when the place was busy on a Saturday night, they always made sure to check in our table and follow through with all the requests promptly. The servers were pretty friendly, and I would recommend this place next time! PS there was free ice cream for dessert"

        "Tara A.": "Zajang Grill is a solid new AYCE KBBQ spot in SF! I took a friend here for her birthday and we loved our experience. I liked ordering through the QR code because we didn't have to wait for our waiter to come. All the food came super quickly after we ordered, though the restaurant was pretty empty when we went (Monday 5pm), so that also might have contributed. For proteins, my favorites were the marinated short ribs, bulgogi, and calamari steak. I also really liked the enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon. I wish we got to try the soft tofu soup and steamed egg, but we were too full! It's a good idea to come with a lot of people so you can try more items. The house green sauce is also really good. We came out smelling really smoky,even despite the ventilation, so wear clothes that you won't mind washing the day after! Overall a solid place for KBBQ in SF. Price right now is $41 per person."

The appetizers are lacking in finesse, however the steamed egg and soup were pretty good.  They have these huge prawns that caught my eye, however takes awhile to cook :( My group thought the brisket was a bit tough, but I thought the meats were like any other kbbq place.  I wish they had bean curd paste and rice paper. I also did not feel too comfortable sitting on stools, wish they had seats with a back rest.  This is a new place so Im sure theyre still testing out some things and I do like the ambiance."

Really can't complain though, we did eat our fill. Our server was very accommodating, given that it was really not that busy for a weekday. My friends and I would come back again to eat here for sure."

To come back here after many years, the memories flushed back like a flood. The exterior and interior don't have much change. The waiting area where the 10 of us were laughing, making fun and the boys sipper on some flavored beers. Oh my Gosh! I was close to tearing reminiscing those good worry-free days. The owner did have a little touch with the interior, not much but it does make the space seem spacious. Luckily, it was Friendsgiving and there wasn't a whole lot of people in the premise. Yass! Easier to breath and we wouldn't be choking on grill smoke either. Food: very delicious and fresh. It is true that they don't have many meat choices. Nevertheless, the ones they have on the menu have good quality. Well, as customers, we always want more and tend to order more than we can consume so I rather have less but focus on quality. I do hope they can add in some more marinated meat choice. Their marinated beef is superb. Ordered 3 rounds of them. Service: fast! Super fast and attentive. They came and checked on us quite frequently which means the grill was changed just before it got all dark and burn. Love it. Extra plus star: the waiters were good looking ;)) like damn!  Thanks to a reviewer that suggest the ice-cream. A nice touch. We had a great Friendsgiving thanks to your restaurant. Keep up and see y'all again soon."

        "Lisa X.": "We walked by earlier with the pup and found out this is their first day, soft opening. Super friendly and very nice interior. This spot used to be Carbon Grill with similar concept, but CG left prior to the pandemic, so it's exciting to have this new addition to the neighborhood. This is an AYCE grill; $40.99 pp with a 90 minute time limit. What I like about this place is that I can order directly on the phone from the table's QR code instead of having to get a server to order which we all know is a hassle sometimes when everyone's super busy. And definitely will cut into that 90 minutes time limit. While the server tonight was super nice and constantly checking in with us, I can't see this realistically be happening once this place gets more customers. I'm pretty sure they will be super busy delivering food, getting drinks, and maybe even bussing tables, etc. So ordering from their QR code is definitely a smart move! From what I can see, very good selections of grilled meats, ranging from unmarinated kalbi, marinated kalbi, steaks, Bulgogi, pork belly, calamari steak, shrimps, octopus, etc. The ready to eat section also has some interesting offerings besides gyoza, they have things like steamed eggs (I made the mistake of ordering this last, it took some time for this to come out). And tofu soup. Which is perfect for a cold night and would be great to get if we had more people with us. I really enjoyed the veggie section with limited but nice offerings with items like king trumpet mushrooms sliced thinly, perfect for grilling. And asparagus which is very nice to eat with all the grilled meats. They also have garlic, jalapeo, lettuce, enoki, etc. We also got a beer to enjoy. Can totally see this being a very happening place. I feel that the price is worth all the yummy offerings. My only suggestion would be to maybe offer a free dessert like a ice cream or some iced beverage to round off the meal."

BNH MI BUILDS: i get the tofu bnh mi: the tofu is soft, warm and flavorful, kind of melts in your mouth. the veggies (carrots, daikon, cucumbers, cilantro) are crisp and the ratio is even between them. the mayo helps make it the most moist bnh mi i've ever had.  chicken/pork bnh mi: the meats are moist, but not oily, and flavorful, but not overpowering. it doesn't feel like the meat is the star of the show either, every component comes together equally. the veggies are the same as the tofu bnh mi.  occasionally, the bread with be slightly dry, or the crust will be harder, but i think it's just because bread is variable depending on age, etc. also, their jalepeos are actually spicy, and plentiful!!"

        "Ed U.": "It's such a low-key operation I tend to forget there are three of them in the city. I think it's because they all close at 6PM sharp, and my cravings for Vietnamese food can come at any hour of the day but mostly in the evenings. I've been to the one on Gough a couple of times just before closing, and sure enough, that was the circumstance for my very first visit here on Haight. In fact, they were folding up the sandwich board just as I entered the premises. They serve a tightly coordinated menu - no pho, three bowls, three salads, three fresh rolls, and probably most popular were the eight banh mis because who doesn't like a sandwich on the run? Trying to avoid a carb overload, I kept it healthy by ordering the $9 Five-Spice Chicken Fresh Bowl. What made it 'fresh', I believe, was that they replaced the rice noodles with iceberg lettuce. In addition, there was plenty of shredded chicken and veggies complemented by roasted peanuts, crispy shallots, daikon, and shredded carrot mixed with fish sauce (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3FZc4eS&s=fb29407d31a4a7691ace524d782ec581637c121df0064ffd694d3932297b6db6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3FZc4eS</a>).

I recently went with friends and we did a bit of a family-style sharing meal, and everything was just lovely.  I got the asparagus risotto there which was so good and filling, and a fair amount of food! Easily could have sustained myself on just that but the appetizers were too good to pass up (and I'm glad I didn't.) Any place with tiramisu automatically gets my vote, but a piece from Beretta is huge! Most places would just give you a sliver, but they are far and away more generous with their desserts.

The mushroom bread is an absolute must for every trip there, sometimes we even order two. The mushroom and cheese topping is so flavorful and creamy on top of a perfectly thin slice of toasted bread. For pastas, I have never have never been disappointed. The olive oil ice cream is salty and sweet and the perfect end to a delicious meal. The tiramisu has the perfect balance of flavors. And to top it off, their cocktails are fantastic.  The staff is always friending and the atmosphere is laid back with at least two tables that are more communal in style. The wait can sometimes be a little long, but you can always get yourself on the wait list beforehand. Would definitely recommend"

It's a pretty small intimate space and very dark inside. I could see it being a great place for a date. The only thing was it was very cold and they kept a side door open to serve the tables outside, and the wind blowing in was super chilly.  For food, some standouts were the walnut toast, the Margherita with burrata pizza, and the prosciutto di Parma pizza. They had a wonderfully thin chewy crust. The gnocchi I would pass on next time. The squid ink risotto was fun to try but a little too one-note for me. I think it makes for a good sharing dish but not a main course. My friend loved the lamb shank. It was also a hefty portion.  We also ordered basically everything from the dessert menu, and thought the panna gelato and crumble di pere were the best by far. The tiramisu and chocolate gelato were just okay.  When I was looking at the menu, I was initially disappointed that they lacked a lot of pasta options, but I'm actually glad it forced me to try the pizzas instead because they were so good.  Overall, had a good time. The service is wonderful and the pizza is delicious."

        "Olivia P.": "Overall, I really liked the vibe at Beretta. The restaurant has nice lighting and the staff is very kind. Unfortunately the food is nothing special. Burrata Pizza: 6/10 This pizza was pretty average and nothing to write home about. It was good, especially the bites with creamy Burrata. I wouldn't get this dish again here. Butternut squash ravioli: 2/10 I love butternut squash ravioli and this one majorly missed the mark. Everything about the dish didn't go well together. The Parmesan ch see overwhelmed the taste of any butternut squash. The pasta was also dripping with butter. It was pretty overwhelming the soup it was in. Lastly, it tasted like cinnamon sugar was dumped all over the ravioli. All those three things combined did not taste good and you couldn't taste the delicate pasta or any butternut squash unless you focused really hard during each bite. Despite there only being 5 raviolis, I couldn't finish it. Lasagna: 8/10 The lasagna is where it's at! This dish is a decent portion size and the flavors are great. You can really taste the meaty sausage in each bite. The cheese and tomato sauce aren't super overwhelming or overpowering. The noodles weren't too over cooked. I personally prefer ground beef with my lasagna, but if you like Italian sausage you are sure to like this one. Sage and Pancetta Gnocchi: 7/10 The gnocchi was good. The pancetta pieces were thin and floppy whereas I prefer mine thick and crispy. There were ounces of mushroom and raw sage throughout. The gnocchi was pan fried and not covered in a sauce - as expected. The gnocchi pieces were good, just nit super flavorful given the way it was cooked. The other ingredients didn't attribute much to the taste. I would have preferred maybe a sage brown butter sauce that incorporated the fat from the cooked pancetta. This would have given it more flavor but the flavors of the other ingredients didn't come off on the gnocchi. And again with all the cheese!"

We attempted to go a Friday night around 6:30 but noticed the Yelp waitlist was closed so we didn't bother trying to walk in assuming there was no space or the waitlist was too long.  Long story short, the following week, we showed up around 5:30pm on a Friday and it wasn't packed at all. My friends say even when the waitlist is closed, if you show up, the wait won't be too long. We ordered some cocktails such as the aejo sour, spa water and el Diablo. All the drinks were really tasty therefore we ordered a second round of drinks. We also ordered the crab arancini balls, olives and broccolini and everything was so good but my fave were the crab balls! The crab was pretty dominating and the aioli sauce it came with had such a good flavor.  We also ordered a margherita burrata pizza to share and it was also a hit. Overall, their service was really great. Our waitress was very attentive and gave us good recommendations. We were there for a bit and did see the place get packed.

We didn't make reservations but were able to be immediately seated on a Saturday morning around 1p, but close to winter holidays. We started with bloody Marys, which are POTENT! VERY spicy (but I love this; great flavor). We also tried the olives, which were huge; a pleasant surprise. I had the prosciutto omelette, which my only complaint is that it's not actually Italian prosciutto in the omelette - it's plain American ham. Now, I know prosciutto is a type of ham, but it's supposed to imply the delicious Italian dry cured variety, not plain American ham. The omelet was otherwise creamy and cheesy though. The husband had the sausage hash with a sunny side up egg, which he described as okay. Nothing particularly special but solid.  Overall, the surprising star of the brunch was the bloody Mary. Would definitely give this place another try."

The sausage hash is a simple but winning combination of sunny side eggs, sausage, and scamorza; I could honestly order it every time. Service is quick, but it may take awhile to get a table during peak dining hours. Intimate indoor seating is perfect for dinner, while outdoor dining is delightful on a sunny day."

On this recent visit, we tried: Beef brisket claypot rice. Beef brisket was tender (tendered enough, but not tough), sauce was mild, light, rice was soft, has that lovely crust on the bottom that's the signature of a good clay pot rice. Mapo Tofu. Spicy but not super spicy, not too oily, balanced, chopped meat, tasty and not overpowering.  Steamed black bean sauce ribs. Mild, tasty, and meaty. Goes so well with rice.  Walnut Prawns. Lightly fried, not too bready, good portion of prawns and honey walnuts. Delightful dish! The meal came with complimentary house soup of carrots and lotus roots! One of my favorite soups actually.

I stood in line as customers in front of me leisurely ordered the glistening fish laid out in ice cases and the fresh crab in the live tank. The fishmonger was happy to discuss the specifics of the seafood with them, but I felt his spirit dissipate precipitously when I ordered the $24 Dungeness Crab Salad over Butter Lettuce. For the price, it was a smallish portion placed on a large wooden platter. I think it was meant to be an optical illusion as it was camouflaged by a side of watercress, grapefruit bits, and radish slices (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3z1nKdZ&s=33e3be48566b3c8c62adce4a25049159bf5b5bd4338b121d4297c5f1c311d79e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3z1nKdZ</a>). What disappointed me even more was that the crab was mixed with some type of mayo, and there were bits of shell left in. I guess it was truly a deli salad and not what I was expecting.

It adds up because even at 4oz (or 6oz for a large), you're paying the price of the fish you choose. It's always sushi grade fish too, which is amazing. I got Tai Snapper and Halibut - recommending this combo because it was so so delicious. But again, very pricey. I think the poke came out to be $25? Wowza. Overall, good to try but not a lunch spot if you want to spend under $15, maybe a fancy lunch, especially if you're on per diem."

        "Jenny Z.": "Fresh, high quality fish for poke bowl I got the kampachi and king salmon with wasabi dressing and the fish was so fresh. There were so many options of fresh fish to choose from and I really appreciated the inclusion of the avocado and nori seaweed. My only complaint is that there were two pieces of bone in my kampachi, but other than that, I would totally come back to try the other fish options!"

        "Maggie A.": "My go-to spot and I can't believe I haven't written a review yet. I come here often during happy hour and get a mixed dozen (or two) of oysters. When family visits, we come here at least once during their stay, and friends from all over SF will meet me here without a noise of commute complaint.  I love the interior with the brick and white tile. It's bright and airy and then the presentation of the oysters with the crushed ice and kelp (I think?) takes it over the top.  Their octopus is also phenomenal. I don't even really like celery yet I love everything in this dish? It's the perfect balance of salt and acid and I cannot recommend it enough.  Billingsgate also doubles as a seafood market and ehike I haven't tried everything, everything I have had has been delicious. Their service is also amazing- you're not going to find a better seafood spot!"

Billingsgate is a cute restaurant/shop that offers quality seafood, wine, and very specific ingredients that will elevate any charcuterie board, hors d'oeuvres plate, or picnic at the park. You order at the till and wait to be served at your table of choice. I ordered the hamachi crudo and cioppino with a glass of Sancerre. All delicious and innovative offering balanced flavors at the finish. I can't wait to visit again!"

French fries with the Greek ranch \"granch\" was crispy and well seasoned. Must get the granch sauce! The soup was lemony and comforting - with chicken and rice.  Such a fun location in Hayes - we sat outside and enjoyed the views! Servers were very attentive and quick."

        "Ron G.": "Somewhere on the 4/5 border since I love their yogurts and wine but I'm iffy on the sandwiches/salads as they're small and sometimes a bit overly oily though generally well-balanced. Souvla is a must-visit spot in Hayes Valley, with amazing food and drinks that won't disappoint. The Greek frozen yogurt with baklava crumbles and syrup is a must-try! The baklava is super sweet with honey, and the yogurt is velvety, creamy, and unsweetened. The sweetness from the honey and baklava perfectly supplements the tanginess of the yogurt. It's big enough to share with a friend, and definitely worth the price. The service is quick and attentive, and the staff is very nice and friendly. The Retsina is also great, though it's more of an acquired taste. This is the only place I can find it, so that's also fun. However, while the salads are fresh and packed with flavor, the sandwiches are a bit small and expensive, so I would suggest definitely eating in and getting the yogurt. The fun industrial aesthetic and outdoor seating area also make for a great ambiance."

        "Jillian P.": "Quick service, solid flavors. Grabbed late lunch on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Ordered at the bar and then took our number outside. Barely waited 2 minutes before we had our lamb salad, Greek fries and spicy harissa sauce. Also ordered a frozen Greek yogurt with baklava; it was a solid order. The salad is large, fresh and well-dressed without being \"soggy.\" The Greek fries were fresh and crisp and were complimented by the spicy harissa dip. The frozen yogurt was the perfect finish - sharp Greek yogurt topped with sweet baklava and a drizzle of honey! Would definitely recommend."

        "Jonathan K.": "Souvla will always hold a special place in my heart because this is where I met my partner for our first meal together  However nostalgia can only get you so far  I've had the pork salad before so I wanted to try the lamb wrap this time to switch it up and the results were less than desirable. The lamb was dry and stringy, with less filling than I had hoped, the salad would've been a better option so that was disappointing. My partner got the vegetable salad which was good, but the side of Greek fries really threw me off, they taste like bland fries you reheat in the freezer, there was no flavor. Plus it's an +1 up charge for ketchup, aioli, or whatever sauces you want, as if the small cone of $6 fries wasn't enough? Plus on a cold night they don't even offer hot water, just room temp water that you pour out of a spigot?  This used to be a nice fun spot with affordable yummy Mediterranean food, but I think I'll have to pass in the meantime"

        "Michael L.": "The menu is simple yet delicious. The lamb and chicken are both great options to add to your salad or sandwich/ wrap. The salads are fresh, creative, and packed with flavor. The chicken salad with romaine, kale, and pickled red onions is my favorite, but the Veg Salad is also a must-try. It's roasted to perfection with a sweet and tangy dressing. I always get the fries as well.  Souvla's Greek yogurt and honey soft serve is a real treat. It's rich and creamy with a subtle sweetness that perfectly balances the tanginess of the yogurt. It's the perfect way to end a meal. Service is quick and efficient, and I like the convienience of ordering first then sitting down. Price is a little high for salads but is reasonable for the amazing quality of the food. Highly recommend giving it a try!"

        "Prasiddha H.": "Had a chance to try the famous Souvla and so glad I did! We ended up dropping by here for a late lunch, and after hearing that it was a nice healthy spot yet yummy we were more than happy to do so. This place you end up ordering, getting a number and then someone giving the food which is awesome. We ended up getting: * chicken wrap - this was delicious and had chicken, feta and these yummy tangerine things which was awesome. At first it was a little dry but as I kept eating the tangerine and sauce in it made it really juicy * fries with a side of harissa sauce - this was delicious and crispy, I loved every bite fully Overall the food is reasonable, good portions and for a healthy yummy meal this is a good spot to go to."

        "Lucy L.": "I've had their Greek fries, chicken salad, and various frozen green yogurt. The fries were nice and hot and the granch had a good tanginess to it. I like a stronger flavor so I mix in their house hot sauce too. I also appreciated the mild spice and sour taste within the hot sauce. The salad was healthy and the best part were they added orange slices. The plain Greek yogurt is great on its own because it's just sweet enough. Any topping adds a lot more sweetness to it, so if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend the baklava flavor. But I do appreciate the sour notes that have been in everything I've tried here."
      },
      {
        "Helen L.": "Chunks of lamb in the wrap sandwich ($16) are all i needed, then you add slices of radish, which don't taste like radish, but it added the crunch. The sauce makes everything go down. Thick pita bread that doesn't get incinerated or get mushy. The wrap was expertly done, so nothing fell, and no mess was created while eating. My order was fast (like 5 min) despite the long line. Hunger pain is gone. Even though i got it to go, i was given a number. I ate at the nearby park even though plenty of sidewalk seats in front. They have a lemon chicken rice soup $7, got to try that next time."

        "Emily Z.": "Came to Souvla for a quick dessert fix! I've been dying to try their frozen yogurt for such a long time, and it absolutely met my expectations!! When you order at the counter, they make the yogurt right in front of you so you don't have to wait for it at all.  Ordered the baklava crumbles and honey syrup frozen yogurt. It's a perfect size to share between two people! It was really creamy and was perfectly tart and not too sweet. The baklava with the syrup added the perfect amount of sweetness to counter the tartness from the yogurt. It was such a refreshing treat after having lunch, highly recommend stopping by just for the yogurt! There's plenty of seating indoors, but there's also a little area to sit outside! Parking can be tough in the neighborhood, but don't let it stop you from getting a quick treat!"

This is by far one of the best fast? Or quick dine in and take out restaurants I've been to! They specialize in pork surprisingly, which I wish I got with the salad but will get next time.  The salad was a real show stopper. The vegetables are obviously so fresh, the radish and cucumber was so crispy, and the pickled onions were absolutely delicious. It's by far my new favorite restaurant salad. We got a side of fries because I love salad paired with fries = balance! And it did not disappoint.  I need to go back to try their honey yogurt!!!"

The employee was really nice and she apologized for the delay. I ordered a custom salmon poke bowl, the fish was really fresh and the flavoring of their sauces was good.

        "Eric R.": "\"Love is the reason why there is pain.\" - Naruto Am I the only San Franciscan that hasn't tried Amitis Caf? The Moderne Japanese Cafe located in NOPA - Just look for the Corgi art! I finally made it and found out it's take-out only. Poke, Sushi, Fusion Japanese are popular here, but I had a Curry over Rice mad craving!  Young friendly Irezumi tattoo'd staff to greet you. I decided to just order at the window counter. Chicken Katsu Curry over Rice is my order as I walk around the block to enjoy the picturesque day in the bay. Less than ten minutes later I return with my order ready.  I decided to take it to Japantown and eat it near the Pagoda. The first bite is usually everything with me and tbh was not blown away by the Katsu. The Curry was of high quality and the Japanese grade rice fluffy. So I took more bites and it's one of the dishes that would be way better eating it freshly made in a caf.  Don't get me wrong it was good, but the Chicken Katsu seemed pre-made for the day, so not as mind blowing as other Curry Houses in the city. The actual Curry was delicious, chunky, and no question \"home made\". All else mingled in harmony and with the Genmaicha Tea from Nijiya made it a perfect picnic!  In the end, I recommend Amitis Caf to anyone into Japanese cuisine. However, I'd suggest passing on the Curry as I found it to be just okay. Go with the various Poke, Sushi, or J-Fusion dishes which seems to fly off the counter here. Expect to bring it home with you or find me under the Pagoda listening to Black Pink..."

Food orders are mostly takeout/pick up. I got the mixed veggie curry plate but, again because they're not completely doing indoor dining, it came in a takeout box . Nonetheless, it tasted fresh and hot and well seasoned! I recommend getting a croquette along with it. That was crisp and cooked perfectly. Food came out promptly too! They were nice enough to let me dine inside with my fur baby. If it's your first visit, check in on Yelp and get a free Thai tea bubble tea"

We both made our own bowls with ahi, salmon, and hamachi proteins and rice base. The ahi and hamachi didn't taste so fresh and texture wasn't the best either. The salmon would've been the way to go. The rice was also sort of clumped together and not the best. Flavor with the sauce was pretty good but a bit over sauced and just squeezed out on top. Food was decent but I don't feel the need to try again soon."

Everything tasted amazing and the portions are perfectly filling.  We came for lunch on Easter Sunday and there were only a couple other parties in the entire restaurant so it wasn't very busy at all. They offer indoor and outdoor dining options but the space overall isn't super big. There's a QR code on the tables where you order and pre-pay from, so the service is fast and efficient, however they aren't really all that attentive, despite not being busy but they were friendly when seating us and did check in every so often so that was nice."

I ordered Nojo's Signature Soy Sauce Ramen ($22) and my boyfriend ordered the Tan-Tan Spicy Miso Ramen ($19). They have an order at table solution so we didn't interact with any staff much. From hitting checkout, we MAYBE waited 5-8 minutes before our food came out. They were super quick and the food was so delicious. My soy sauce ramen was spectacular and there was an entire leg quarter in my ramen! The chicken was so tender, juicy, and flavorful! The broth had such a depth of flavor and noodles were cooked perfectly! My boyfriend liked his ramen dish as well. It definitely did have a different taste and the spice level on his was spot on!"

Plus, it's located in the cute neighborhood of Hayes, which means you can easily walk to dessert spots or bars after your meal if you want. One thing that stood out to me was the friendly staff. They make ordering easy with QR codes on the tables, which is a great touch. We started with some appetizers, the yuzu cucumbers and the calamari. While they were okay, they weren't anything special and I probably wouldn't get them again. But let's talk about the real stars of the meal - the ramen! We ordered the soy sauce ramen and the dry spicy ground chicken tossed noodle, and they were both amazing. It was the perfect combo to share because you have a soupy noodle and a dry noodle. The flavors were rich and satisfying, and the noodles had the perfect texture. I'm already planning my next visit to Nojo so I can try the other ramens.

We got the soy sauce tori paitan ramen and it was so flavorful. I would recommend you order this ramen since the chicken meat just falls off the bone and it's so soft and juicy. The staff was great, we did not have to wait long for our food to come out. I am looking forward to coming back again."

I appreciate that tori paitan ramen can be found at a few places in SF, and Nojo specializes in it. I ordered the Tan-Tan Spicy Miso Paitan ramen and the broth was very delicious with a lighter flavor than the tonkotsu broth. I'm also a fan of ground chicken or pork in ramen, as it soaks up the broth nicely. For the price ($18), I wished they included a whole egg (2 halves). I'm used to adding a whole soft boiled egg when I make ramen at home. Pretty good ramen if you can stomach the SF prices"

Here are the items I tried: - shrimp & grits (3/5): I was craving some shrimp & grits, and unfortunately this didn't quite hit the spot fully. While the shrimp & grits here were okay, this dish lacked a bit of flavor. I was it was cheesier and more seasoned. - chicken & waffles (4.5/5): This was solid! The fried chicken was moist on the inside while crispy on the outside without being overly oily. The waffles were solid too. - cornbread (5/5): Despite being pretty full, I just couldn't stop eating the cornbread! The cornbread here is a bit on the sweeter side and just so addicting! I'd come back here just to order this. - biscuits w/ gravy (4/5): Delicious! The biscuit was fluffy, and the gravy was good too without being too salty.

        "Derek S.": "Came by for dinner the other night and it was a mediocre experience. Made a reservation and our table was ready upon arrival after checking vaccination status and ID. Parking was available on the street. Dining room was indoor only. Staff were all wearing masks covering both their mouth and noses, without gloves. Started off with the zucchini fritters and they were the highlight of the meal! Lightly friend with tons of juicy zucchini inside along with the side dip that was excellent! The lamb chops were a disappointment, comparing with Evvia and Kokkari. The entre came out with 4 huge chops cooked to a medium rare as requested. The flavor profile wasn't super balance and the lamb chops weren't super hot when they came out. The side of mashed potatoes were decent. Service throughout the meal was great by the waiter."

We came for my birthday dinner with 8 people with a very last minute reservation request which was initially declined but the group that was supposed to be there that night canceled last minute and got the spot. We ordered a bunch of food to share. I recommend getting the meza platter with extra pita. It is phenomenal. We also loved the lamb which is cooked absolutely perfectly and comes with mashed potatoes. Sooo good. They have a great wine list too. The only thing I wasn't head over heals for was the salmon kebabs. Seriously don't wait on this get yourself here and in the door. If coming on a weekend night definitely make reservations to ensure a table. Great date vibes as well. Right now this is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco."

Service was great and food was delicious.  Highly recommend the lamb kabobs. I'm not a huge fan of lamb but this was delicious! Cauliflower and dips with pita were good too. Moussaka was different than anything I've tried. I'm not sure if I loved this dish. Definitely get the kunefe if you have room for dessert!"

        "Steffi L.": "I cannot sing enough praises for this place. Kitchen Istanbul is a crown gem in the Inner Richmond neighborhood. My partner, pals, and I have made a habit of coming here often, and every experience we've had has been some of the best here in the city. So great in fact that our +1's have always returned to book a reservation with a guest of their own. For birthdays, dates, anniversaries, business meals, girls night out, solo excursions--name any occasion that you may want to visit for, and your meal here is sure to delight. The staff is so welcoming and thoughtful in the way that they explain and recommend things from the menu. Their extensive wine collection (the restaurant also doubles as a bottle shop) is organized on the menu in a way that'a easy to peruse no matter what you're in the mood for. Embrah, the owner of the restaurant, always makes a point to say hello at least once to all his guests during their visit and is very knowledgeable about what pairs well with the dishes that you're ordering. Gizem, who has typically been our waitress, is the absolute sweetest. She's always waved & stopped by to say \"hi\" to catch up with us. We had the pleasure a few visits ago where we got to chit-chat with Embrah about inspiration for the dishes featured on the menu & the overall atmosphere within the restaurant. And from what he has aimed to achieved with his restaurant, he's totally nailed it. Dining at Kitchen Istanbul is like being invited into somebody's home for meal. The space is kept in a way that feels more intimate: there are only 8 or so tables within the space, most of them seating pairs.  The food itself is not only delicious, but delightfully consistent. Every single time I've visited, the things I've ordered has always tasted as I've expected to from my last meal at the restaurant. It doesn't matter what you order. Every component of the dish. Whether you're eating the carbs, meat, or veggies together or individually, you can tell that they're all treated with a great deal of care. My favorites in particular are the zucchini fritters, braised beef, veggie moussaka, and kunefe. It's become so standard for me and my boyfriend that the staff still recognizes our order and our bottle of choice whenever we visit: 2018 Irene Narrow Gate Vineyard Grenache (El Dorado, CA). Treat yourself and book a table through OpenTable already. If it's for Friday date night, make sure to book at least a week in advance."

        "Ellen H.": "Being a fondueholic it was becoming somewhat embarrassing that I had never set foot in this place. Well, it finally happened! I went, I saw and I conquered the cheese and mannnn it was worth the wait let me tell you that.  Ordered the Moiti-Moiti (classic fondue) and the Emmentaler fondue and absolutely loved them both. The entire time I dipped in one pot first and said \"this is my favorite\" and then went to the other pot to say the same. They were both delicious. You get boiled potatoes, homemade bread and pickled veggies with the fondue for dipping. Whilst a little disappointed they did not have gherkins (cornichons), the other dippers definitely made up for it. We ordered a side of seasonal veggies on the side which were green beans sauteed in onion and tasted like my mom made them. This all made me incredibly happy.  Prices albeit not cheap, were definitely reasonable also for their wines. We often make fondue at home and hit about the same number just by buying the cheeses.  The interior of the place is worth a visit alone. It's a tad kitschy and that also gives it its charm. Can't wait to take my nine year old with me next time. Bummer that they are closed on Sundays though.  Service was friendly and attentive, especially given we had a later reservation and the place was packed."

        "Allison H.": "Currently my all-time favorite restaurant in SF. Swiss-themed food and decor, this place is great for cheese and charcuterie lovers. We have been here a few times so far, and find it whimsical every time (look out the window at the train set, and pay attention to the decorative items)! I lived in Switzerland for a bit, and this place is such a nice nostalgic punch.  Their main menu features not only typical German/Swiss entrees, but more importantly many fondue options, with cheeses / cheese blends representing different Swiss cantons. They also have beef fondue, which is worth trying once if you've never had it. As a starter, the alpine board is a nice sampler, and the Raclette is a good option if you're not getting fondue (but otherwise I'd think it's too much cheese). My only complaint is that they could have more non-basic wine options (and more Swiss specific wines).  The restaurant gets very busy and people stay for relatively long durations, so a reservation via OpenTable is a must. Despite the busy-ness, the waitstaff is so helpful in helping explain the different cheese/wine options, and very friendly. Warning - Walking in you will be hit with an extremely strong cheese smell, and you will walk out smelling like it. I recommend wearing clothes you're prepared to wash immediately after."

        "Isabel W.": "I recently visited a fondue restaurant in town and it was an absolutely delightful experience. The restaurant had a cozy and intimate atmosphere, which made it perfect for a romantic date or a fun night out with friends. One of the highlights of the restaurant was their pretzel appetizers, which were a must-try. They were soft, warm, and absolutely delicious. The pretzels came with a variety of dipping sauces, including a cheese fondue, which was the perfect way to start the meal. The main course was the fondue, which was served with a variety of bread, vegetables, and meats. The cheese fondue was rich and flavorful, and the chocolate fondue for dessert was a real treat. The portions were generous and the staff were happy to refill the dips and sauces as needed. One unique aspect of this fondue restaurant was the ski box, which was a private dining area that was perfect for a small group. The ski box had a cozy atmosphere, with ski-themed decor and a rustic feel. It was a perfect setting for a special occasion or a romantic evening. Overall, I highly recommend this fondue restaurant for anyone looking for a cozy and intimate dining experience. The pretzel appetizers were a must-try, and if you can, be sure to reserve the ski box for a truly special evening. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the fondue was absolutely delicious. It's definitely a spot I'll be returning to in the future"

        "Mia B.": "Have been dying to go here for so long! The experience was very cool, just wish the ambiance had been better this visit. We were able to get a reservation the same day on a Saturday evening by stalking OpenTable and were very excited. We were seated in an elevated area which was nice, but unfortunately (and this being the only true detriment to our meal) there was a wildly obnoxious and large party seated next to us. While this is not necessarily the fault of the restaurant, they were so loud and even fighting sometimes that we could not have a conversation almost the entire time and it was slightly upsetting. Other guests were staring and it was really just a scene.  Beyond that, you order per person so we ordered one of the Traditional Fondue and one of the Beef Fondue. My partner was hesitant about the beef but it truly ended up being one of our favorite parts and it would have not felt like a complete meal without it. The cheese comes with bread, boiled potatoes and pickled vegetables, of which the bread is the best part. All of this can keep coming so we got more bread. The beef comes with the meat to cook in the stock as well as a sort of smashed crispy potatoes and sauces. None of those are items that can keep coming but they were all delish and filling so no need to order more.  The cheese itself was a bit earthier than I expected, the waitress said it was their \"standard\" one (at the top of the options, has a Gruyre base I believe) but I think if I returned I would try something sharper like the Swiss ones or maybe even milder. The beef stock is not the most flavorful but it doesn't need to be, the meat does it's part and is deliciously seasoned and tender.  We also had a glass of the ros which my partner did not enjoy but I thought it was fine, a bit on the sweeter and juicer side and definitely not a dry wine but decent nonetheless.  Including tip we paid around $100 for two people which felt fine for fondue, I would come back but try a different cheese and request different seating as well."

        "Bradford L.": "Fondue is so hard to find anywhere, and I was pleasantly surprised to find this place via TikTok!  My friend and I made a reservation for 5:30pm on Saturday, and by the time we left around 7pm, the place was packed. I highly recommend making reservations in advance!  Upon entering the restaurant, there is such a heavy but delicious aroma of cheese and white wine. We ordered the Heimat and a gold winning cheese fondue, which came with unlimited bread, pickled vegetables, and potatoes. The fondue was delicious - great acidity, flavor, cheesiness, and white wine flavor! I absolutely loved using the bread and potatoes to soak up the cheese, and using the pickled vegetables to cut the fattiness.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate fondue, which was a little less memorable. Delicious, but not something I'd look to get again.  Overall, I'd be back to try their other fondue options! Such a cute establishment in SF!"

        "Claire L.": "First thing youll notice is the cute thematic decor, peep the model train running in the back. The alpine board was quite good, especially the flower looking cheese. The raclette dinner was very good and fun to make. We got 3 cheeses: Emmental - the group's favorite, a much sharper cheese flavor Moite moite - my personal favorite, had a savory and smokey flavor Savoyarde - everyone's least favorite and unfortunately our biggest order. Perhaps because the cheese was so mild the white wine overpowered the taste Pickled veggies were very good!  Service was also very good, my only big complaint is that we got seated 45 minutes after our reservation time. But even though we had to stay an hour after closing we didn't feel rushed, and they gave us ice cream and macarons to make up for the wait so I can't be too mad. Would probably come back for a special occasion!"

        "Joe R.": "Finding a Swiss restaurant in the US is not always an easy task, so when I found The Matterhorn Restaurant & Bakery on Yelp while hunting for good places to eat on my SF weekend holiday getaway, it was a no brainer that I had to give it a try... Boy was I impressed at this restaurant! It is right on Van Ness Avenue and almost a little to inconspicuous from the sidewalk, but low and behold, you will find it and be captivated the moment you walk in and be swept away to the Alps! I so love Switzerland, so this restaurant is a must do for anyone like me who also loves the country! The menu is full of wonderful selections and our waiter Fabian was so friendly and helpful and really impressed us with a number of suggestions he made for dinner including two fondue's which were extraordinary! We were really hungry when we arrived, so the though of just ordering fondue didn't seem like it would be enough to fill us both, but do not be mislead by ordering fondue for two, it really is enough in my opinion for three or maybe even four! There was a lot of food left over after we were stuffed and because we were staying in a hotel, it made no sense to take it with us - such a shame... The Savoyarde fondue was velvety smooth and so rich on flavor - highly recommend it and be sure to order a side of apples with it too! The beef was melt in your mouth tender and was fund to cook in the beef broth in the fondue, but I will say it took a good amount of time to cook each piece and the serving size was generous so be prepared to linger a while for dinner. The dinner came with three sauces to accompany the beef, which were all wonderful! You also get to portions of potatoes, the first of a seasoned variety and the other of small sized boiled. All this great food and very attentive service to boot! We were so stuffed after all this good food, that there was absolutely no room for dessert which I will say I was disappointed with myself, because I was looking forward to see what was offered and knowing how much I love Swiss desserts I am sure I would have enjoyed immensely, but I couldn't even bring myself up to look at the menu! I can't wait to the next time I am in SF because I am sure planning to go back for more, but next time I will be more cautions to quantity of dinner options so I can leave some room for dessert for sure! If your in SF, you MUST try The Matterhorn, just know that it is on the pricy side - dinner for two with one glass of wine and no dessert was just over $200 with tip and the 6% Healthy tax SF imposes on your bill on top of the normal sales tax which amounted to $23.17."

The service was very attentive and the ambiance is cute as the restaurant even has a landscape model of Switzerland with a toy train running around it. We got the Moiti-Moiti fondue ($28) since it was recommended as a milder cheese. I thought it had a very strong white wine taste, which made it easy to get palate fatigue. My favorite things to dip in the cheese were the pickled veggies, which provided a nice contrast. Overall, the fondue was rich and creamy, but the flavor was a bit strong for me.  We also tried the Veal Zurich style ($28), which came with a 3 day mushroom white cream sauce, spatzle, and brussel sprouts. The sauce was delicious and the spatzle was nice & crispy. I ended up enjoying this dish more than the fondue, but I would come back again to try different cheeses!"

We also asked to have a piece of focaccia with tomatoes and rosemary to bring it at home because we already tried the plain one and it's more than amazing (soft, good quantity of oil, not heavy).

The housebaked focaccia was light and airy with a slight chew and crisp exterior. The slice of speck was very salty so one was enough, with the fresh peppery arugula helping to cut the saltiness from the speck and goat cheese (?). I was recovering from a tooth injury so I had been avoiding eating nuts and/or picking it off dishes so it was a surprise when I bit into several walnuts inside the sandwich.

        "Adam B.": "A new cute little bakery and coffeehouse on 18th Street, which is a nice alternative to the chains nearby. A very large variety of both sweet and savory options to satisfy any morning craving. Only a few outdoor tables though, so people watching spots are a hot commodity. Veneziana: Reminded me a little of a Mexican concha, but with a smaller amount of sugar on top. Had just come out of the oven when I got it, so very fresh. Loved the fresh bread against the sweet strands of sugar. A subtle delight. Cornetto Prosciutto Brie: Looks like a croissant sandwich, but according to the internetz a cornetto is not quite like a croissant. A little less crunchy/flaky is the main difference I picked up on, but it was still lighter than regular bread for sandwich purposes. The fatty brie was an excellent pairing and the salty ham livened up my morning. Focaccia Caprese: Very simple with just focaccia, tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. The tomatoes were some heirloom orange variety; tasted less vegetal than red tomatoes but also weren't as a juicy. I took them up on their offer to toast this, which made the focaccia warm and crusty and so nice. The fresh mozzarella kinda got dried out a bit though and made the bread a little soggy where it was. Might have to try their focaccia sometime with drier ingredients. Raspberry Pistachio Brioche: More croissant like than the cornetto in texture, with those nice buttery and flakey layers. Inside in the middle was a decadent raspberry filling. I thought the regular pastry part was fine, but once I was hit the jam, I kinda wished it was everywhere. I didn't taste any pistachio with the raspberry jam though, so I'm guessing they're just referring to the pistachios on top. Apple Tart: The barista described this to me like a tarte tatin. And it was in the sense that the top had caramelized apples. But they were thin slices rather than big chunks, so gave a lesser caramel taste. Underneath was a moist grainy cake that paired very well with the apples. And the crust was hard, like a nice buttery shortbread."

Mushroom Mapo Tofu - This was the hit. Very good flavors. Again, generous portions. Other ingredients that are not normally in a Mapo, in a good way. Also good and interesting, how do you cook the black beans? We would come back just for this, but again maybe add a protein? Today we had a very healthy dinner, LOL. Significant to-go orders while we were dining in. More of a to-go place then a sit down. They partner with UberEats, Doordash, Grubhub, and Postmates. Atmosphere - Small local restaurant with 6 tables. One table outside, but this is SF winter so no one is crazy to sit outside in 40 degree weather. So small that you can hear everyone's conversations. The place looked like the owners built it themselves, you got to love DIY! Street parking, good luck. Open 6 days a week from 11:30 am to 9pm, closed Mondays; I suggest adding this to your website. Service - This is where they lacked. Just one person, I believe the owner, was working the 6 tables and all the deliveries. Her daughter was riding on her scooter, then watching videos and games on her phone, etc.  Price - $42 + tip; all 3 menus had different prices. The menu posted on the window, the one she gave us when seated, and the QR code menu... I really suggest getting that corrected as NO one likes surprises!

There was just enough soup in each of them - and just enough flavor in the soup - to be satisfying. At $10.95 for 10 bao, an excellent value. Similarly, the pork potstickers were crisped beautifully and featured decent helpings of meat inside. Truth in pricing alert: they rang up as $8.45 for 6, even though the menu had $7.95 as the price (see attached photo). Still a good value and, alongside the XLB, thoroughly filling and delightful in the way that good old comfort food ought to be. Service was fast and efficient and they do a steady takeout business in addition to serving about 6-8 small tables inside. An excellent find thanks to an Eater list."

        "Lisa X.": "Nice neighborhood place. The XLB we tried was good, not too thick, piping hot and delicious. The broccoli beef was okay. A little heavy handed on sweet dark soy sauce on this dish. The fried chicken wings was perfect. Not too oily or overly salty. Crunchy and satisfying. Simple but cute decor inside the restaurant. Service was good."

        "Brett G.": "Dim sum plus standard staple mains for SF dim sum spots. Overall, was not very impressed and for the same price you can find much better in the area. Would be good if it wasn't the Bay, but can't recommend given the options in town. Notes on takeout: that they said pickup in ~35 mins but sent me a notice the food was ready after about 18mins. Accordingly the food was not at peak freshness but since I'm expecting this is common for pickup I'm only giving them a slight bump to adjust for this. Notable dishes: Shrimp Har Gow: wrapper was the perfect thickness but the filling was a little on the light side. Overall very good but not quite the amazing plump ones you might get at Dragon Beaux. These were the winners and a reason to potentially return. Shumai: Just not good - some of the worst I've had in town. Extremely dense/hard, relatively dry/overcooked wrapper, slightly off taste/smell. Soup Dumplings: Mediocre. The freshness from takeout might have been an issue but they were light on soup and the meat was not as fragrant and flavorful as I've had. Not much different from Trader Joe's ones."

        "Belinda L.": "I was looking for a place to takeout food from for Valentine's Day for my father. He likes eating chow fun. When my sister finally confirmed that we would be going over to visit Dad and that the establishment was open for business today, I placed an order on the website for Shrimp Dumplings, Pork and Shrimp Dumplings, Xiao Long Bao Soup Dumplings, 4 Seasons Chow Mein with Chicken, Chow Fun with Chicken, and Wonton Soup at 12:25 p.m. I received an email and text that the order would be ready at 12:55 p.m. My sister started driving us over from Sunset Irving St. where she had been running errands.  There happened to be a parking space right in front of the restaurant. We observed that quite a few tables were occupied for lunch. We parked and sat in the car to wait until 12:55 p.m. However, at 12:41 p.m. we received a text and email that our order was ready for pickup.  I went inside and the lady checked with the kitchen. They needed 2 minutes more. I noticed the origami decorations hanging that I had seen from the car. The food was still hot when I delivered it to Dad.  Unlike wonton soup from other restaurants, this wonton soup is full of vegetables as in bok choy, broccoli, carrot slices, and some sort of white mushroom. There were 6 wontons.  My sister thought the dumplings were fine and nothing special. I can see where that would be the case if you have eaten at Din Tai Fung at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in Southern California. However, Din Tai Fung is at another level. The quantity is generous at 8 versus 3 at a dim sum restaurant. The shrimp dumpling skin is thinner. The chicken added to the chow Mein and chow fun is what is to be expected, I guess nowadays, with an additional charge of $1.50. There is meat, but not in great quantity."

We had a few drinks, which were all good. The service was great as well, friendly staff, attentive and brought everything out quickly. When the food came out, that's when things started going downhill.  We got the bam bam shrimps, brussel sprouts, and hash puppies for appetizers. This was the best part of the meal. The shrimps and brussel sprouts were great, hush puppies were under seasoned and tasteless.  Our mains which included the shrimp po boy, gumbo, fried chicken and cajun pasta. Thankfully, I got the shrimp po boy which was definitely better than everything else. It's what is helping this rating out a little. The fried chicken was surprisingly bland, the crunch and the look were all there, but it was not salted well and the seasoning just didn't come through. The gumbo and cajun pasta had the exact same problem. It's like they forgot to add salt to EVERYTHING. The whole table agreed that this was a very underwhelming meal for that reason. Definitely had higher hopes.  The place itself is alright. They had a live band that I wasn't really into, but we sat in the back where the sound is more bearable.  Rating is mostly governed by the meal, everything else was good."

The front space is beautiful and has a lot of character but the back room is kind of sparse and densely packed for seating. There was also no music in the back, so it was a bit odd only having other people's conversation be the background noise.  They only had one bartender and one server on a Thursday night - not sure if someone called out or if that's standard staffing, but it wasn't sufficient. The place was fairly busy and the two staffers were getting run a little ragged. It took over a half an hour to get menus, water, and a cocktail on deck.  The mac & cheese was great, and I really liked the fish. I thought the cornbread muffins and hush puppies were overly salted and kinda meh.  I may go back to the bar at some point - the Vieuxcarre was excellent - but will probably not dine in again."

We walked past it twice and kept missing it! I recommend trying the Crawfish Pot Pie! Crispy and buttery pie crust and the filling is delicious. They don't skimp on the crawfish. I just wish the pie was bigger. It definitely came out smaller than expected.  The Crawfish Hush Puppies were just okay. I feel like the oil they used was old, or maybe they were overfried? I did try some of Maw Maw's Gumbo! The shrimp in there is SCRUMPTIOUS. The gumbo itself was a little bland, but overall pretty good!"

So oily. The light in the back room was not turned on and sunset was upon us. Finally, light switched on. We can see our food. The crab cakes were ok. The sausage stuffed mushroom, same oiliness (need to put on paper towel first before plating. Entree. Catfish looked good. My companion's catfish portion was really small. She didn't complain. About 1.5 cups of rice. The first bite of green beans it was salty, and some sort of cajun spice got stuck in my throat . Coughing with tears. The rice had a cajun kick, so if you are not into spicy, please skip. I can handle some spice, but not that potent. I ate the fish and packed the rest to go home to add more ingredients to counter the salt and spiciness. Wait person offered to give me new beans, but that would mean throwing out the food on my plate. No, thank you. Her comment: this is a cajun restaurant. Thank you. Our mistake for trying this restaurant. We should have known better. We specially asked for no powder sugar on beignets, which was great. Enjoyed the caramel sauce and blackberry jam, not so much the watery chocolate sauce. Apple galette. Those were some rubbery crusts. Chewey. It's hard to cut. Had to leave on the plate. Service was attentive. The wait person had to serve all 5 tables in the back. All twelve of us plus a kid. The wai person was an energizer bunny."

As shown by my pictures, I have sampled many dishes and drinks here. I loved every single item that I have ever ordered. One thing that is not pictured here, but I would highly recommend trying, is the green gumbo. It had a delicious taste and some crispy pork in it I believe.

Dark lighting, slightly loud but very mindful diners, the decor... the restaurant just gives off a very chill vibe. Service: 10/10. Our waitress was friendly, quick, and attentive despite our large group. Food: 9/10. Most of the items here are kind of spicy! (Cajun based) Cajun fries - Crispy, spicy, and tasty. Crawfish hush puppies - Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Generous serving for crawfish inside-- kind of like a medium sized meatball. Creamy cajun pasta - We all loved this one. Super creamy, delicious, and spicy! Pasta was good perfectly as well. Crawfish pot pie - A bit bland but still baked to perfection with a crispy layer on top. Maw maw's gumbo - Only 6 pieces of shrimps :( although they were grilled to perfection, they were way too salty. Rice was cooked very well as well and the sauce was really delicious and spicy. Drinks - 10/10. We tried a variety from beer to cocktails and no one had any complaints. I had Marie Laveau, which had a slightly strong taste of gin (which I liked) + fruity + tart that eventually became much lighter after the ice melted.

It's literally an \"underground\" sushi restaurant because as you enter, there's a flight of stairs down to actually reach the seating area.  The price for the quality of fish is amazing! Every roll is around $10-16, and each roll I've had tastes fresh. The food comes out fairly quickly as well. I'd recommend getting the Spicy Golden Gate (spicy salmon, shiso, cucumber, tobiko) and Dragon Roll (imitation crab, eel, avocado, and tobiko).  There's always a DJ playing current hits, throwbacks, and everything in between to entertain guests. The bar is always busy with folks drinking Sake bombs! The atmosphere is everything you'd want in a night out: food, music, and good vibes. They don't take same day reservations, so if you have a big party call ahead because it can get packed. There's a Yelp check in tablet at the hostess table :)"

We eventually found a parking garage about 3 blocks away for $20 (worth it for the peace of mind of your car not getting bipped). Right when you walk down those stairs, the vibes were already right. Live DJ. Dim lights. Simple menu. We opted to sit at the bar as the table area looked tight. Service was friendly and food came out at appropriate times.  For the 2 of us, we ordered Agedashi Tofu (5/5), Salmon Kama (4/5), Ika Maruyaki (5/5), Jumping Unagi (3/5), Philladelphia (5/5) and Soft Crab (4/5) rolls. I enjoyed all of it!

The \"jumping\" roll options (deep fried) are delicious with a thick breading and crispy coating. The Mar 2023 special with flounder and jalapeo was the favorite of the table with a creamy texture and fresh taste. The Volcano roll had peanut butter inside if you're looking for a unique roll. Also enjoyed the Big Mama with egg and bbq eel.  I would personally pass on the whole grilled squid but it definitely had a fresh taste and great texture for those who love squid. Glad I tried it."

I was so conflicted on what to order because almost everything on the menu had a price that was unjustifiable for the food you'd get. like why is a california roll w tuna and salmon on top (their 49ers roll) listed as market price... i ended up still getting that and was shocked to see it was only 6 pieces. i will say they are pretty large in size, but definitely not large enough to compensate the price and that there's only 6 pieces. I also got grilled mackerel cuz the roll was not filling enough and it was nicely flavorful and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  service was also good, I was really thirsty so I was drinking a lot of water and they refilled it right away every time and the lady who was serving me was very kind and sweet.  overall, even though I do wanna try their sashimi because everything seemed really good quality, I can't justify going back because of the price cuz there's so many great sushi places w much better prices."

Waiting for food took quite a long time, but our waiter do come back and forth with us to let us know our dishes are coming  Here's what we've ordered Chicken karaage - 4/5 It was very nicely fried, only thing is the chicken karaage itself is pretty big, I wish they would cut it a bit smaller. Omakase - 5/5 We shared omakase of chef's choice. It was a decent portion for 2.  Unagi plate - 3/5 A bit disappointing. The rice was not as soft as we expected. unagi was good but still need some flavor. Salam skin handroll - 2/5 This is pretty disappointing, it doesn't taste good at all. You can ask them to make anything into a handroll.  I would definitely go back again. I'm excited to try more of their sashimi."

The last few times have been a little underwhelming but maybe that's just because our expectations have been too high since the last visit. The rolls that we ordered in more recent visits seemed to have a higher ratio of rice and were just smaller in general. The chirashi bowl was yummy but the pretty display on top hides a large layer of rice underneath that I felt was a little disproportionate.

They have a security guard out front which was interesting. First off, this place is lively. Love the vibe and energy, especially sitting at the bar. While catching up with the sushi chef is a natural thing, they were clearly in production mode and had very little time to chit chat. Their fish is fresh, we presented, and delicious. Seems like a place that a lot of tourists visit but also a local recommended spot as well. It just happens that both my patrons on the left and right were also in town for work. We shared some thoughts around the menu, and all seemed to be delicious without issues. If you are in town and looking for a cool, hip spot for sushi, this will be up your alley.

For sushi we ordered the dragon, 49er, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, tempura shrimp rolls! All were soooooo good. The fish was so fresh along with the other ingredients. Down to the crunchy cucumbers everything was so fresh.  The spot is underground and they have a live DJ a few times a night! It's a low lit spot and the music is 10/10. When I was there on a Sunday night they were playing throwback rnb and it was such a vibe. Staff is very friendly and service was fast even though they were down a person!

We also enjoyed the takoyaki, shishito peppers (got a spicy one!), edamame, and croquettes. The skewers had good flavor but were a little tough. The miso was amazingly flavorful but had a little too much cabbage and onion for me. It's a great spot for dinner with a few good friends.

I was like why did I even come around this time, BUT having dinner at Izakaya Mayumi really turned my night around. In LA, where I'm from, there aren't many legit izakaya places. I was stoked when my friend took me to this restaurant.  To start, my friend picked out a bottle of Makiri sake (you know, to get a little buzz going). Makiri translates to \"demon cutter\", which is pretty cool huh? If you like your sake with a dry aftertaste, this is it! It has a clean and deep flavor.  We ordered a couple of dishes that were all 10/10 for me: Simmered Tai Aradaki head - wow, it was simmered in soy sauce (and mirin I think). It came out hot and the meat was so tender. You could just taste the fish was good quality. This is a must-get because I've never really had this dish at other izakaya restaurants before.  Hokkaido uni with ikura - wow (again), the uni was FRESH and SWEET. It came with nori so you can wrap it with ikura in a tiny burrito. Eat it with one bite so it's extra satisfying. Also, it's super fresh. And the color is beautiful.  Fried chicken skin - I don't usually like to eat any skin, but these taste like chips! They are so good and they'll keep you wanting more. They're nice and crispy with the perfect amount of oil. Yellowtail sushi - This dish is more basic BUT you can taste the freshness of yellowtail. Some places that serve yellowtail sushi have a fishy taste but this one tastes delicious. We didn't order too many dishes but so far this is my favorite izakaya and I will come back to visit again! The ambiance feels cozy, clean, and intimate, which I like.We"

Most veggies rolls you'll find are so boring and carelessly put together. However, this one comes with a delicious sauce, several different veggies and its not mostly rice! Its a nice veggie dish to refresh the palette after all the other foods you decide to eat. Ag dashi tofu: they put a lot into their broths and sauces here. The tofu is simple as it is fried lightly but the dashi broth is what sends it to higher heights. The broth is slightly jelly-like and is balanced between chickeny, seaweedy, sweet, and salty. They top it with lost if grated ginger and green onions.  Karaage: they give HUGE pieces here! They simply give you a lemon to top it and it adds acidity to balance the fried fattiness.  Service: Its a small place so everyone is very attentive. There is one waitress that knows my order by heart at this point and I love her. She is so sweet and wonderful.  Ambiance: quiet, small neighborhood place."

        "Wendy T.": "This spot is the definition of a neighborhood gem. Boyfriend and I went in on a Tuesday evening, it was a bit slow inside, but we didn't mind it because the service was da*n near perfect - waiter was attentive, food was being served quickly, water was constantly being filled. Our experience here was quite enjoyable, and we look forward to making this spot our go to spot when we are in the area, craving sushi/small bites, and don't know where else to go. Every fish dish was super fresh, and especially the Negi Toro Roll - that b*tch melted in my mouth once it entered my mouth. All the other rolls we got also really hit the spot. We also ordered one fried dish of the Agedashi Tofu, and it was one of the most unique ones I've had. Tofu is silky, but the fried batter on the outside is light, crispy, but also a little gooey. It was quite a lot of different things all in one bite, and just very tasty too. Loved my experience here!"

        "Generous Y.": "Heard about this place from a tour guide a while back. Didn't get a chance to try it before I left but I made my way back. Close to the piers and Fisherman's which is helpful. Prices were pretty good given the location. Huge portions. Looking at the menu, it's pretty obvious what to do. Order the combo. And that's how we ended up with four combos. There's seating covered by a tent but no restrooms available. Small-ish menu which makes ordering easy. Takes about 10-15 minutes and your food comes out burning hot. Tartar sauce was fantastic. Combo - fish, shrimps, and chips. What more could you ask for? Again, super hot food so I took my time snacking on the fries before the fish and shrimp because they were burning. The pieces of fish were gigantic, pictures do not do it justice. However, the breading coats the cod in a way where there's some space between so it can be misleading, but not much. Prawns were nice, but cod was the star of the show. Ultimately, taste wasn't particularly phenomenal, but all things considered the Codmother was exceptional. Great location and portions."

        "Amanda M.": "Large portions  This place was right around the corner from our hotel. It was food truck with a permanent spot. They had outdoor seating. The day we went it was cold and rainy. They had some coverings to keep dry.  Limited menu of fish, shrimp, and fries. We tried the combo that came with fish, shrimp and fries. Very large portion. I tried the tacos. Although the fish and toppings were good it was on corn tortillas and not flour. I am not a fan and didn't see it listed on the menu. Just a heads up. I ended just eating everything but the shell.  The food is cooked to order and they call your number when ready. It comes out hot and fresh."

        "Arshad H.": "The Codmother Fish & Chips is a highly rated fish and chips spot on Fisherman's Wharf. They are a food truck with several tables outside. I was eager to get my fish and chips fix so I ordered their combo and a clam chowder bowl. Combo ($19) - This consisted of 2 pieces of battered fish (average size), thick cut fries, and 4 pieces of shrimp. Without the shrimp, this is $17. The fish was flaky and the batter was light and crispy, however it wasn't as good as Gordon Ramsay's Fish and Chips. Plus the pricing here is several dollars more than Gordon Ramsay's, which is a little surprising considering that this is a food truck with a few outdoor tables. The shrimp and fries were both crispy and went well with the cocktail sauce and ketchup. New England Clam Chowder (no bacon) ($13) - I was impressed with the taste of the clam chowder here. It was rich and creamy with an average amount of clams and potatoes. It definitely should have had more clams given the price point. Overall, I really enjoyed the fish and chips here, as well as the clam chowder. Pricing here is RIDICULOUS and the reason why I will not be coming back. It's a ONE and DONE deal for me."

        "Diana B.": "Order to go on the app since I wanted to try multiple foods in the area. Didn't get to take a picture bc I was super hungry as it was the first meal that came delivered.  The cod tasted good but the batter was a little thicker for me. It was soft by the time it got to me, but it wasn't bad. I personally like the fish itself but the batter was more pancake texture like. It had a mild flavor and not too salty which I like. The fries were not it for me. I personally like my fries thinner and crispier. The cheese was already clumped too. If I come back, I would eat it fresh from the stand, not to go, and no fries.  The tartar and Baja sauce were pretty good too. I'm really surprised it wasn't salty as most places I go, peoples sauces are overly salty to me.  Burien Fish House in Seattle would still be something similar to my liking because I'm particular with my batter being crispy."

It is pick up service with adequate outdoor seating and umbrellas for shade. This is a good stationary food truck so there is no indoor seating. There is parking on the street and paid parking near by on the same street. The food is so good. Everything was fried and amazing. I ordered the fish and chips the fish was cooked to perfection and the fries tastes like they are fresh cut and fried and they have a few selections to choose from I suggest the garlic fries they're amazing. The clam chowder is some of the best I have ever had, so creamy with a good amount of clams the sourdough was fresh, soft with a great chew and the fried calamari was cooked to perfection. This place is amazing I highly recommend you check them out."

        "Mary A.": "During one of SF's Free Museum Days, my friend and I stopped for lunch at The Codmother Fish & Chips food truck at Fisherman's Wharf. I opted for their combo, which includes 2 pieces of fried fish, 4 fried shrimp, and a bed of fries (which I upgraded to their Fully Loaded Fries). I'm always used to heavily battered fish, but to see that the fish here is lightly battered really made the fish stand out! The fish itself was very tender and the fried shrimp was crisp and juicy. The fries were an explosion of flavor, with the melted cheese, garlic and their baja sauce. Paid extra for the upgraded fries, but I honestly think it was worth it! It was a rainy day in SF, but there was ample covered outdoor seating around the food truck, allowing us to eat the food immediately even in rainy weather! Cost: -Combo (2 fried fish, 4 fried shrimp, fries) = $18.99 -To upgrade regular fries to Fully Loaded Fries = $3.50"

It's a small restaurant, only about 8 seats at the bar, and a small room to the right as you enter that has a table for 4, which is where we were seated. The room is small but cozy, and has a sliding door for privacy if needed. The staff were great, we were greeted at the door and shown to our table right away, our water and tea were always filled without us having to ask, and both servers always took the time to not only explain each dish, but also answer any questions we may have. It almost feels like we're dining at a friend's house! The food was amazing, it not only looked beautiful, but tasted fantastic. Difficult to choose a favorite as they were all so good. I loved the appetizer plate because not only did it looked great, but the different flavors and textures of each seemed to complement each other. And of course, they were all so cute, being a one bite size! The wagyu was out of this world, so buttery, and just melt in your mouth goodness! The accompanying truffle salt, wasabi, and pepper sauce just lifted the Wagyu to the next level, which I didn't even think was possible! Another memorable dish was the fried tile fish, so simple yet so amazing, the scales on the fried fish just added another dimension to the flavor and texture. Let us not forget the steamed abalone with egg yolk vinegar either, it was served with thinly sliced cucumber and seaweed, and garnished with a piece of pickled ginger flower. Never dreamed of mixing egg yolk with vinegar or knew that it could make such a delicious accompaniment to steamed abalone! The dessert of soy milk pudding with caramel sauce was the perfect ending. Every dish was so delicious, I cannot say enough about the whole meal. I would definitely like to return and taste more of this chef's creations."

        "Andrew S.": "Located at the top floor on the corner where Ichi-pub was, Kappo Yuji is a very hidden and snug bar with only bar seats and (possibly a private room, which I saw out the corner of my eye). Upon entering, you'll be greeted by your host and seated at the bar where the chef will serve you from.  - Amuse - Chawanmushi - 4/5, very delicious snow crab on top of a pretty plain chawanmushi. Unfortunately I couldn't shake the slight hint of dish soap flavor in my chawanmushi. Otherwise, a very good amuse-bouche. - Assorted appetizers - Marinated Mizuna - 3.75/5 - very light, not too flavorful. Slight crunch. Maybe marinate in a stronger soy-vinegar? Boiled Bluefin tuna - Not sure this is actually what I received, so I won't rate this. Miso pickled Egg yolk - 1.5/5 - inventive, quite a thick custardy-chewy texture. Personally I felt it was too big for one bite, and too overwhelming of a single flavor amongst the rest of the (more refreshing) appetizers Daikon wrapped Smoked salmon - 3/5 - slightly bland, but fresh. I enjoyed this almost as much as the monkfish liver. Cod milt with Ponzu sauce - shirako has always been a 'miss' for me, so it probably wouldn't be worthwhile rat Monkfish liver - 4.25/5 - Fairly standard monkfish liver sliced and in light ponzu - Soup - Claypot in Soup (Dobin mushi) - 4.25/5 - I really liked the presentation and flavors of the soup, but again it had a slight hint of dish soap flavor.  - Assorted sashimi - Today's fresh fish - 4.75/5 All the sashimi was quite good. My preference is always more towards a tender bit of tuna, whether bluefin or yellowfin, I don't mind - so a change to pieces like Ika was definitely different than what I am used to. The Shiso leaf, shiso flowers, and wasabi were all presented very well with the sashimi. - Grilled Fish - Grilled Chilian sea bass with Shiso paste - 4.5/5 - very tender and juicy fish. With a few drops of yuzu juice, makes for a perfect few bites. - Warm dish - Steamed Sea Perch with Sea urchin - 4.95/5 - My favorite warm dish of the night. It was definitely one of the most flavorful, albeit a bit difficult to actually manage with a spoon. I think it would've been more fitting to serve with chopsticks. - Warm dish - Abalone gratin - 1/5. This really felt out of place for me. Texture was very very chewy, and the gratin almost felt like it'd been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour.  - Chef's special - Roasted Japanese Wagyu & Sansho pepper sauce - 6/5 - Definitely the highlight of the menu. This was served with half a brussel sprout and a line of black truffle salt, which reminded me of a previous kaiseki I had in the peninsula.  - Sunomono - Seared Belt fish - 3.25/5 - A little bit bland again, I think this would've gone well with a ponzu or similar sauce.  - Deep fried dish - Deep fried Tile fish - 4/5 - I wish the fish was salted after deep-fried because the fish itself wasn't very flavorful without salt. It is really neat how tile fish scales are so thin and tender that you can just bite down on it as if it were a very crispy batter. Reminiscent of another restaurant I had in Singapore, which also served tilefish in this exact way. - Rice and Soup - Clay pot cooked steam rice - 3/5 - Personally, I felt the rice may have been cooked a little bit too short. Quite sticky and hard center on the individual rice granule. Akadashi miso soup - 4/5 - red miso soup, a little bit tangy. Very rich flavor. Assorted pickles - 4.25/5 - standard Japanese pickles. - Dessert - Custard pudding - 4.95/5 - Good way to finish. I felt it was a bit too jello-like to be considered a pudding, but that didn't stop me from consuming the whole cup in two bites. It has good flavor, very much like purin - that I would eat all the time as a kid. Overall, the service we received was impeccable, and with a few more years of practice, I can see Kappo Yuji being my go-to for Kappo Kaiseki."

        "Julia N.": "One of the best dining experiences I've had in the bay!! It was just as good, if not better, than the michelin-starred Japanese restaurants in SF. The chef has over 25 years in experience in Japan!  It's on the 2nd floor - look for the Pagoda Cafe and then take the stairs. There are also only 9 seats- it's a really intimate setting and will make you feel like you're in Japan. Yuji offers a kappo-style omakase (similar to kaiseki), which is rare to find in the Bay Area. I believe Kappo means \"to cut, boil, stew and fry\" so you will experience different Japanese preparation styles with extremely high quality ingredients such as a5 wagyu, truffle and Hokkaido uni. I truly enjoyed every dish here - each dish just got better and better. I definitely think it is worth the price ($180) for the amazing experience you get here. I would highly recommend for a special occasion!"

        "Austin W.": "I had a chance to dine at Yuji this past Sunday with my wife after booking a reservation a month in advance on Tock. The meal was fully paid for ahead of time online, so the only thing you need to take care of after the meal is any drinks you might choose to order during your meal. Yuji was a bit difficult to find location-wise. There's no visible signage for the restaurant until you get to the top of the stairs and enter the building. Once you find Yuji, it's a very small and intimate space with only 8 or so seats at the bar. Overall, I had a wonderful experience. The pacing of the meal felt really good as well. From start to finish, our meal ended up being about 2.5 hours. Twelve courses is a lot of food, so come hungry.  The highlight of the menu for me was the Japanese wagyu beef that came about halfway through the meal. For my wife, the tempura tile fish was her favorite. Saucing and seasoning is very delicate on each dish. This is probably one of the few times in my life I've had seasoned salt and now I can't get enough of it: truffle salt and matcha salt are incredible. Many dishes feature generous amounts of uni so if you're a fan of uni, you're in for a treat. My least favorite dish was probably the amuse bouche -- the monkfish liver. I did not particularly care for the texture or flavor of the dish. Looking around at some of the other guests dining with us, I could tell this was also not their favorite dish. I think Yuji definitely has the potential for a Michelin star. Come check it out before it becomes impossible to grab a reservation."

        "Eric L.": "This tiny nine-seats-at-the-counter restaurant is practically impossible to find, but the meal itself flows gracefully over the course of two expertly-curated hours at the hands of a brilliant chef. The Michelin guide will definitely notice this place; it might have opened too late for Michelin stars later this year though. Practically every dish brings joy. Highlights included wagyu (because, of course) that was seared so perfectly that I'm still ashamed I occasionally try to cook my own wagyu at home. The biggest surprise was a deep-fried tilefish, a sweet and buttery fish rarely seen on menus. But my favorite might have been a simple marinated asparagus; I didn't know a vegetable could do that! The only disappointment was a grilled Spanish mackerel; it was good, just not great, and probably suffered from being surrounded by overwhelmingly-impressive food."
      },
      {
        "Amanda N.": "Wow... this place will definitely get a Michelin star. It's only been open for 3 months now. There are only 9 seats per seating so get on it fast. Okay so here's all the details... Located in Japan town there's parking either on street or a parking lot nearby. Inside the pagoda, you walk up all the stairs. There's some construction going on, but it's there! You'll see the pub sign, but then you'll see the white curtains that'll show you the restaurant sign.  Upon arrival, you check in. You pick your seating. You are then greeted by the chef, himself... YUJI! I asked him for recommendations for sake by the glass since it was just me drinking and he offered me an off the shelf sake. It paired perfectly well with the dishes. Out of the 12 courses, I wasn't fond of two, but everything else was a 5/5! Some of the dishes were surprising and awed my mind how perfectly cooked some ingredients were delivered. The chef was so kind and it made the experience 1000x better. The diners were also friendly due to the intimate setting. Definitely recommend to everyone."

Given we came a bit late, we were told our table is no longer available and then we proceeded downstairs to finders keepers where they had open seating. After going there, my friend decides to buy me a cocktail at the bar. We ask the bartender (male, wore a flowery patterned shirt yesterday) what cocktails on the menu he likes, with an attitude he responds \"whiskey neat\". We asked him for a cocktail recommendation from his own menu, is this how you respond? You work in the service industry, is this how you talk to a customer? At least mention a drink from your own menu? Anyway, my friend and I order our drinks, we pay and leave. The bartender says he will bring out our drinks.  We join our group who is sitting/standing near by. As the bartender comes and gives our drinks, he has the audacity to do this: He asks us what we do for a living. We respond that we work in Tech. Then in front of the group he makes a comment staying \"Well bartenders make a living on tips and the tip you gave is not good enough and is rude\" or something to that extent. He says this loudly, in a rude and confrontational manner in front of the entire group. Firstly, is this how you behave in the service industry? You didn't treat us properly when we wanted to order a drink and then you have the audacity to ask (rudely) for a higher tip.  Let me also remind you: Tipping is optional and Tips are also separate from wages. They do not affect an employee's rights under California wage and hour laws. Meaning employers in California cannot offset tips against regular wages. If that's happening take it up with your employer Members Only LLC, not with your customer. Either way, after he gave us our drinks, my other friends didn't order and wanted to leave. He finished our drinks, informed what happened to the host on the way out and left.  At the end of the day, very bad experience, drinks were so so, service was terrible, location is in a sketchy area. We ended up going to propagation, a speakeasy bar a few mins walk away from Members Only, where they had better service, better music and better drinks."

Upon pulling up you'll be greeted by the ambiance of prostitution standing outside, they are literally outside standing.  There is no parking at all anywhere, the bar just happens to sit in the middle of all the parking garages and they're far walks. Street parking is your only option. And you'll have to walk down a block of prostitutes.  The pork bao wasn't good at all, the fish tacos were gross. The chicken sliders were meh.

Sat at the bar area, and service was very friendly and fast. It's on the pricy side, but worth it for the food quality and atmosphere. Would recommend. Drinks: 8/10 So good! Loved the presentation. Would recommend the Bramble. It had a sweet berry flavor and came in a cute bear-shaped (I think?) cup. The other drink came with a little toucan sitting on a stick of cherries.  Pork buns: 7/10 Buns were soft and fluffy. Perfect bite-sized pieces with tender, melt-in-your-mouth glazed pork belly. The pickled veggies add a crisp sourness. Leaned on the sweet side, and I would have liked more salty flavor. But overall a great appetizer. Cheese and artichoke dip: 7/10 Comes with crispy bread pieces to dip in cheese dip. It was gooey and had a nice cheese pull. Did get a little cold. The ratio of dip to bread was a lot, and we ended up with a ton of leftover dip. Not complaining though because we were able to reuse it as dip for our other appetizers. Truffle fries: 9/10 Highlight of the night. The ketchup was so rich! Fries were a perfect blend of soft and crispy."

The meowie wowie felt so sophisticated with so many distinct flavors like pineapple, cinnamon, and so much more that all worked together. Well balanced, and not too sweet. It also packed a strong punch!  Their version of the hot toddy was also really nice. I could taste the hint of cherry tea in there, which made it relaxing. Also packed a punch!!  The only thing I'd dock a star for is because the waitress seemed upset at us for some reason? Maybe we did something wrong? Not sure lol. I know my husband and I were being googly eyed at each other bc of Valentine's Day, but I don't think we were being rude or anything!

As impressive as their design style and vibe are both their cocktails and food. The menu is broken down by raw bar, shared bites, and mains. Pretty straight forward. On this first visit I went with their shrimp tacos, pork belly bao's and the deviled eggs. All were very tasty and well composed simple dishes. Look forward in testing out their other menu choices.  Equally as cool as the upstairs is there lounge down stairs with full bar service there, though the foot print is smaller and would say more intimate.

        "Joel Christian A.": "Truly great takeout spot with staples like kimbap (bulgogi, carrot and cucumber wrapped in rice and seaweed) and KFC (Korean fried chicken in a crunchy batter and sauced).  Can't go wrong ordering this via food delivery or pickup yourself. Order ahead and they make pickup a breeze!"

        "Iris P.": "Ordered Aria off of DoorDash and I kid you not, it only took exactly 7 min from the charge hit my Apple Pay to when it arrived at my door (to be fair we live extremely close to Aria, but the speed at which they fulfilled the order was incredible). We got one of the larger combos that came with 20 pieces of chicken and the bulgogi kimbap. The portion sizes were positively brolic, they definitely don't skimp on giving you chicken (we must've had at least 10 extra pieces). Overall, everything was super delicious, and the delivery speed absolutely cannot be beat."

      {
        "Wendy D.": "Went here to buy their bulgogi fries, kimbap, and fried chicken! My absolute favorite was their kimbap, which was super savory and filling! The fries will get pretty soggy if you don't eat them instantly and I don't recommend trying to reheat it. The soy garlic fried chicken was a little bit too saucy for my taste so I'll probably opt for a sauceless chicken next time.  This street food kitchen is strictly pick up only and if you're lucky the spot in front of the store will be free for a quick emergency light pickup. Otherwise you will have to go through a pretty sketch walk in the Tenderloin to reach your destination. I would recommend doing door-dash if safety is of concern to you! However, I did a pick up order from online and and scheduled a time for my food. The cashiers had my food bagged and ready to go the second I got there! The price adds up quick and can be pretty expensive but the food is well worth it."

        "Tay H.": "Their kimchi fried rice with spam is one of my favorite comfort foods. I really think it is the best kimchi fried rice I've ever had. I could also drink their green sauce, which seems to be a jalapeo and cilantro situation. It's so good. The combo of these two together is heavenly. Everything else we've had is also great and I especially like the KFC taco, but nothing beats the kimchi fried rice with spam and green sauce."

I enjoy the 10 piece Gangjung Fried Chicken coated in Sweet and Spicy sauce with chipotle aioli on the side. Truly, can't beat this and worth every cent! I've also tried the Bulgogi Fried Rice which was pretty good too, but trust me on the fried chicken it is a MUST!"

        "Cheena A.": "TASTY BULGOGI FRIES & KIMBAP This is strictly a pick-up spot, so there's no seating available. It's a small shop tucked in the Tenderloin area, so safety and parking can be some issues. But I still love coming to get their food, it's worth the quick stop for me! I do recommend ordering online for pick-up instead of ordering in person and having to stand around waiting for the food. Either way, service is pretty quick, and the staff here are usually friendly and on top of everything.  I've gotten their Homies (3 Korean-Mexican tacos) which has the Korean Fried Chicken Taco, GangJung Fried Chicken Taco, and Bulgogi Beef Taco, plus don't miss out on their Korean Fried Chicken. All food I've had here are great, but my absolute favorite things here are their Bulgogi Kimbap and Bulgogi Fries! I love this type of food, I know I'll be back soon for my regular Bulgogi Kimbap with Garlic Soy sauce for dipping and some Bulgogi fries!"

I am still dying to order this again. Portions are also huge which was very appreciated.  I would avoid going in person later at night since it is located in Tenderloin, but Doordash is the move."

      {
        "Rehab K.": "I doordashed Aria, especially after seeing the ratings, but it was extremely disappointing. The fried chicken rice bowl was decent but we also got the bulgogi fries and the kimbap which were both terrible. As a Korean restaurant, this is some of the worst bulgogi - dry and artificially sweet. My main takeaway would be to most definitely not get the bulgogi fries. It's topped with terrible a rubbery cheese and drenched in a coyingly sweet sauce."

        "Kathe B.": "We ordered from Aria via DoorDash because we were staying at a hotel & Uber for 7ppl to a small restaurant just didn't make sense. The delivery driver came pretty quickly with the order, which was a surprise! I ordered a Combo B and extra Amigos, bulgogi fries, some sauces and a kimchi to share some small bites before we left for our show. Upon unpacking my order, I realized we were shorted the entire bulgogi kimbap part of our order, literally 2 whole rolls valued at $16! I tried to call Aria several times, no answer. Tried over the next 2 days to email them 3 times too, all with no reply. The chicken pieces were OK but a little dry, both in doneness and a little light on sauce. The tacos were OK, but had large pieces of chicken and too much sauce, so they were soggy and fell apart.  I never heard back on the missing part of the order, and ultimately made a dispute with PayPal but they can't verify what I say was missing. DoorDash doesn't take any responsibility either, because its not their job to verify what is or isn't in the bag?!?! Overall, a pretty crappy experience for over $100 dollars for chicken!!! If you want to try Aria, better go to the restaurant so you can verify your order is complete!!! Because you won't get any reply otherwise..."

        "Lisa W.": "Probably the best dumplings I've had in SF and one of the cheapest meals too! The dumplings had a thick chewy wrapper without compromising on the amount of filling and I loved that there was an option to get it with soup (chicken soup) Cucumber salad: 10/10 recommend! The price was pretty good for a lot of cucumber. The cucumber was crispy and the soy sauce/vinegar/sesame oil dressing was very light and refreshing (I probably would've drank the whole thing LOL). Pork, chive and shrimp dumplings with soup: 10/10! The dumplings were so flavorful and this was the my favorite dish! You do lose 2 dumplings if you choose to get it with soup but I think it's worth it because it keeps the dumplings hot and the soup is very savory. Napa cabbage and pork dumplings: 8/10! Not as flavorful or salty as the chive dumplings, but if you like something lighter/less pungent this is the way to go! So tasty and I definitely could've eaten this nonstop.  TLDR; get the cucumber salad and I recommend getting the dumplings with soup!"

        "Ivan Z.": "okay I don't know if I have pictures for this but on a cold winters night this is a fantastic place to get dumplings. it has the vibes of a lower east side or flushing dumpling house (unfortunately with SF pricing but we'll take what we can get) and it's EXTREMELY cute. I felt bad that I didn't order in mandarin but that's okay.  The dumplings come out in these huge bowls that feels extremely home cooked and delightful in the best way and you can also get a HUGE BAG that's frozen to go as well for a reasonable price. and they're made by chinese aunties so like... what more could you want here????"

        "Dexter D.": "We wanted a quick meal near where we found parking. San Francisco is probably the only place where I'll let the parking dictate where I'll eat. Just because you park in a well-lit and populated area doesn't mean that someone won't try to break into your car in San Francisco. We probably used to eat in San Francisco once a month and now it's maybe twice a year. This is a very small restaurant. I think that there were six or seven tables. English is a second language so one has to be patient and hopefully not have a lot of questions. The menu is quite small, but the flavors are excellent. I think because the dumplings are not huge, when the ingredients are mixed and placed into the wrapper, not every ingredient makes it into the dumpling. In a couple of the Pork, Shrimp, Chive and Egg Dumplings, the Shrimp was lacking while others had a lot of Shrimp. The Shiitake Mushroom and Fish Dumplings were delicious!"

        "Cynthia T.": "Pretty good spot for dumplings. I got the fish and shiitake mushroom. It's yummy with their chili oil. Thankfully the two times I went, it wasn't terribly busy but I've seen their lines go out the door whenever I'm in the area."

        "Michael S.": "Oh, just another hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant with super awesome, authentic Chinese food. No big deal. Except it IS A BIG DEAL! IT'S THE HUGEST DEAL EVER!! Okay, maybe not the hugest, but you feel me, right?! Is it even possible to have enough good restaurants in the world? Sure, if we didn't need to eat to survive. But we do. So there can't be. I went with the Spicy Beef Thing and it had awesome flavour, but not awesome spice. Must be from a region of China where they think that black pepper is spicy. Or avocados. hahahaha, could you imagine... If you know me at all, you'd know that I burned TF outta my tastes buds long ago. Only the worst pain gives heebie jeebies. And then the diarreebies. And then the pain starts again! HA!"

There was a good amount of other people there, but my friend and I were seated immediately.  I love a simple but effective menu! We shared an order of the spicy beef noodle soup and shiitake fish dumplings. It was a good portion of food and we were both happily full.  Spicy beef noodle soup - it's the same clear broth as the non spicy version, but they add chili oil on top. It wasn't too spicy, but left my mouth a little numb after we finished the bowl. The broth was tasty and it was overall a solid bowl of noodle soup. Shiitake & fish dumplings - these were really good but the shiitake flavor is really strong so I would avoid these if you are not a fan of that. The dumpling wrapper was the perfect thickness and so chewy! For me, dumplings are best enjoyed dipped in just black vinegar. Don't forget to make make your own soy sauce / vinegar / chili oil mix for dipping!"

My sister and I were stuffed after the soup and dumplings. It's a pretty small restaurant but there was seating as soon as I walked in. We were served pretty quickly as well. Would definitely come back to try more! The house beef soup is delicious and both dishes I tried tasted so fresh."

        "Soon Tani M.": "Favorite dumplings spot in SF hands down. I love watching the ladies in the back folding dumpling after dumpling. This place is always consistently good and if I lived closer I'd be here every week.  Cucumber salad: Crunchy, garlicky, vinegary. So good.  Peanut and celery salad: Sleeper hit. Probably my favorite appetizer.  House special beef noodle soup (spicy): Comes with lots of beef and bok choy. I think the noodles are made from the same dough as the dumpling wrappers. Noodles are chewy and bouncy and the broth is beefy and good.  Pork and celery dumplings: Comes with 14. I love getting this or the napa cabbage and pork dumplings. I wish my homemade dumplings were this good.  Service is great and attentive and the ambiance is calm. Good for small groups (1-4 people). They also have a freezer on the right side for frozen dumplings to go!"

        "Angie Y.": "This place is one of my favorite spots in sf!! The dumplings are so homey and you can watch the aunties make it through the window so you know its fresh and authentic. They also sell packs of frozen dumplings, so that's definitely a good sign. I honestly forget everything I've tried, but the menu isn't big so you really can't go wrong. The dumpling skin and noodles are perfectly chewy and satisfying, just like how it should be with hand kneaded dough. The dumplings have juicy and flavorful fillings (especially pork, shrimp, chives, egg) with a good ratio of skin and meat. I thought maybe their specialty would be dumplings but both beef noodle soups are amazing as well, with flavorful and warming broth, tender chunks of beef, and the crunchy veggies."

        "Amy S.": "Excellent dumplings. We had Pork and Celery Dumplings and Fish and Shiitake dumplings -- both were solid. The cucumber salad was delicious and crunchy with a light sesame dressing. My favorite dish was the Pickled Cabbage Beef Noodle Soup. We also had the Tofu Skin Stick Salad which was underwhelming. The place is small and cozy, the service is fast and the price is very reasonable for SF. They also sell frozen dumplings by the bag that you can cook at home."

        "Erin J.": "Honestly this was such a meh sandwich to me. Def fresh ingredients, good roll, and good service, but the actual sandwich just wasn't that good. I got the mozzarella, roasted tomato, avocado with added chicken. For my boyfriend, i got the OMG. We split them. Getting the spicy sauce on the side may have been a mistake. I kinda forgot about it for my first half (the chicken mozz) but my second half, the OMG, I added it and it made the flavor really pop. Def recommend the spicy sauce!  Either way, both sandwiches were pretty disappointing, and way way overpriced. $43 for both, and they aren't large sandwiches. I'm 120 pounds and i easily finished a full sandwich in one sitting, even though I usually save half of a deli sandwich for later. For comparison, these things have to be 1/4 the size of Palm City sandwiches, which are actually slightly cheaper by a dollar or so. Probably won't be back. Will try Rossi or Hot Johnny's next time!"

I didn't want to drive all the way to Berkeley remembering how delicious Heroic was the first time I went. I'm so glad they had a sister restaurant only 3 miles away from where I was. Since everyone raves about the OMG! I had to try it, and the name totally fits this sandwich. First off again the bread Is amazing! It's crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside and very light not leaving you feeling heavy after eating the whole sandwich. The meats were divine. Sliced paper thin and literally melts in your mouth. All the condiments in this sandwich made it amazing in flavor and that truffle aoli was to kill for. If I ever eat a sandwich with meat it won't be anywhere else!!!! Had to grab another box of the delicious marinated olives and one of their Italian sodas."

        "Tracey A.": "Is this a case of the tail wagging the dog?  Swirl on Castro has invited Heroic Italian into their wine shop, ostensibly a bid to allow one to eat while consuming the alcohol Swirl serves up. But this works both ways: Heroic Italian brought me in. A glass of wine and a Pliny the Elder (a steal at $6) from Swirl were the nice afterthought.  However you cut it, this is a win-win proposition for both the businesses and the consumer.  If I weren't sitting in a Covid-era al fresco structure on Castro with '80's pop songs being piped in the experience could almost have me believing I was in Rome. Heroic Italian doesn't have an extensive menu (almost exclusively sandwiches and salads) but what they do have will practically have you crooning an aria. Good stuff that had me recalling my last visit to Italy.  Two of us shared the Gladiator Salad ($16) which is a salad for lovers of cured meat. Featuring Italian Prosciutto, Spicy Salami, Copocollo, Porchetta, Mortadella and more, this is not the sort of salad I'd choose for myself but as a shared offering it was perfect.  A shared Quadronno Sandwich ($16) though? I'm not even a sandwich lover but, arriving at the table oozing melted Burrata, this thing was a dream. Orders are placed here via a QR code and I'd checked \"spicy\" but not paid more for \"extra spicy\" and neither should you. One bite in particular left my eyes watering and it took a while for that to settle down. I'd still get it spicy - not extra spicy - but I'd approach the sandwich with more caution. Any way you approach it though, this was a marvelous sandwich.  Both the salad and the sandwich featured bread from Montesacro Pinseria, also in SF and about which I can only say \"best bread ever\". Though it was clear the fillings were top notch it was the fantastic light, chewy, and crunchy bread that elevated it above what it would otherwise have been.  You can, of course, order a soda from Heroic Italian but you're here at Swirl so you may as well go big. Perhaps a bottle of Italian wine should be added. In our case, it was a glass of wine from Switzerland ($11) of all places, and a nice big bottle of icy cold Pliny the Elder IPA, bargain priced at $6.  A little taste of Rome on Castro Street; I didn't know it was needed but it was. It most certainly was."

        "Alpha F.": "I'm not sure about this place while the food looked delicious, I did not enjoy the dressing on the salad and I ended up not finishing it. Additionally the service was very poor, they were slow, and didn't bring any water or utensils for the salad. Furthermore, they only had outdoor seating but it was raining and the seats were all wet. Another major complaint is the online ordering/paying system. I had to select the tip before I was able to experience the food or service which felt scammy to me."

We first tried Heroic Italian on one of the YES events and we have been coming back time and time again. My favorite is the Quadronno, but we really like all the sandwiches, salads, etc. Fresh ingredients, tasty, and the bread--really delicious. What's great is that they have salads too for those of us that want to eat less carbs. And if you like wine, they share a space inside Swirl so you can enjoy wine with your food. Outside seating available by sidewalk or in a parklet."

        "Karen S.": "I'm always on the prowl for a good sandwich. Like when ppl ask the age old question, which carb would you choose to only eat for the rest of your life, I'd choose bread over rice or noods. When ppl say they're cutting carbs out of their diet to lose weight, I could never.  I ordered the chicken tetrazzini sandwich for one reason- green peas. I love them. I was of course disappointed to see that my sandwich barely had any green peas or mushrooms. I made it thru 90% of it before even seeing a speck of green. I thought maybe the other half would have more. Nope.  Yet my two friends who got the same sandwich had theirs stuffed with them! I was extremely envious as I watched them devour their sandwiches, while constantly looking down at my own sadwich (not a typo). For a place that charges $17+ for a sandwich, they should have better quality control. Maybe they made mine last and were running low on ingredients? It's not an acceptable excuse tho. And for a sandwich at this price, I honestly expected it to be larger/more filling. Deliboard is about the same price point and I can barley eat half of it in one go.  The chicken itself was nothing to rave about, and was kinda dry tbh.  Perhaps the worst offense is that they fucked up the bread. The top part of my bread was over toasted and had the texture of chips instead of soft bread. Each time I took a bite, it was so crispy that there were crumbs/flakes flying everywhere.  I'm honestly really upset whenever I have a meal that I feel was a waste of calories. They had a leg up already since I was starving after a workout class nearby, and it just didn't hit the spot."

        "Amy S.": "Love coming here for a quick bite to eat! It's on the way from my apartment to Dolo so it's my go-to picnic food. I typically order online for pickup and they always do a great job of having my order ready super quickly. FOOD - OMG (5/5) - This one is my default order every time and it's so good it makes it hard for me to branch out and try the others. They're very generous with the cured meats inside, but it's still well balanced with the bread and other ingredients. I always order it with the \"spicy\" modifier (if you get it on the side it's $.50 but free if it's in the sandwich), which is basically this pickled pepper mixture that adds a nice acidity and heat to cut through the saltiness of the meats. The sandwich is on the saltier side given the nature of the ingredients so would definitely recommend having a bit of water (or a glass of wine ) to wash it down. - Genoa (3/5) - Had really high hopes for this one but it was just ok. The shredded chicken was a bit dry and unseasoned, and the pesto was overly oily and drenched into the bread. Each bite felt bland but also too oily, so probably wouldn't order again.  OVERALL It's 5 stars just for the OMG, but at $17 it's definitely more of a treat yourself sandwich than something I can consistently get for lunch."

The atmosphere at Dragon Horse is comfortable and relaxed, making it a great spot for a casual dinner with friends, families or a date night. We saw two groups of people celebrating birthdays there yesterday. I order nigiri at every sushi restaurant I go to, so this time I chose 5 pieces Chef's choice Nigiri. The fish was top-notch, every piece was so fresh and my friend loved her Kampachi sashimi as well. We also ordered White Dragon roll and Crazy Spider roll. After waiting like 10-15 minutes, our server came to apologize saying there was a technical issue so our sushi rolls order was not sent to the sushi chef timely or correctly but it's fixed now and our rolls came out in a few more minutes. Sometimes things happen. I appreciated the communication and prompt service. We liked both the sushi rolls we ordered, especially the Crazy Spider roll. For drinks, I ordered the no ABV Jade Emperor, with cucumber, mint and some other stuff,so refreshing. My friend got the Kisetsu. We gave both drinks 10/10!

I loved the interior decor and lighting, the service was professional and very gracious The food itself was decent. I got the Yakitory (super awesome), the chicken karage (a little bit more cripsy/slightly burnt than I expected, but still worth), and the truffle albacore tuna tataki (loved this one). For drinks I grabbed a Smoke Umame (salty vanilla butter Kavalan) and a bijou highball (forgot its menu item name). The smoke umame wasn't too heavy and I would definitely get it again. The bijou highball was delicious! Tasted sweet and went down more like juice, almost as if it didn't have alcohol. I asked for an individual check and saw they already added the service charge into it, so that was perfect. 5/5 everything. Will definitely come back!"

A lot of seating, good for parties.  Service was pretty bad. The waiter or bartender or whoever took our order completely forgot our main roll- the dragon horse roll. Seemed like a sweet person but really was just all over the place. Fortunately, the order was placed and then removed from the bill but only after we had to remind them about it.  The best dish would be the karrage. It wasn't anything special. Fish was fresh. I got the toro sashimi (a special) and then we also got a spicy tuna roll, some nigiris and some sort of salmon tataki. Salmon wasn't bad but it just tasted like fish. There was no other flavor profile from the sauce or garnishes. Drinks were ok, we thought they were nothing special either.  The total bill was like 218 including tip. I thought it was a bit much and probably wouldn't venture back here. Now, I like that they are open until 1am, late night drunk sushi might give it a better rating."

Paid $390 total (with tips) for the food. After the chaos, the manager offered a 10% discount for the next time.  When I told my friend that I heard the cocktails were amazing here (via Yelp), her face lit up. I knew how much she love craft cocktails, so Dragon Horse was the perfect place to celebrate her bachelorette party dinner in San Francisco. We were a group of 6 and dined here last Saturday. After we sat down, I realized I have been to this location in November 2021. Each of us got one cocktail: My bride-to-be friend is a huge fan of whiskey, she ordered Smoke Umami and really enjoys the flavor. She ordered a second drink, Heaven and Earth, and was blown away by the drink as well. Two other girls ordered Highball but weren't too hyped: Cognac Highball has strawberry and Toki Highball has matcha, but they didn't taste any. I had Kisetsu and it was good. Bride-to-be's Smoke Umami was a half-size pour of my drink--our glasses are similar in size. She was a little bit sad with the pour but I guess that's what crafted cocktails are for. 2 girl friends ordered Bermuda Triangle. One drink arrived with the other 4, and one was left out. We checked with the server twice, then her drink finally came... after the food was served.  Soon after the cocktails were served, we then ordered the food: Tori Kara Age, Albacore Tuna Tataki, Wasabi Tako, Panko Shrimp, Seafood Ramen, Tori Paitan Ramen, 3 Beef Skewers (2 in one order), 3 Gyu Shita Skewers (2 in one order), Crazy Spider Roll, Dragon Horse Roll. Beef skewers and Gyu Shita skewers were served first, those were really tasty. Then Tori Kara Age and Panko Shrimp were next, I thought the taste of Tori Kara Age was a mixture of Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken and Japanese Chicken Karaage (\"Tori\" means \"Bird\" in Japanese) and all of us really liked it. The ramens were interesting for us, my friends said Seafood Ramen tasted better than Tori Ramen. Those look identical so we weren't sure which one was which at first, but when we saw pieces of salmon in one of the bowls, we immediately knew that was Seafood Ramen. I don't have any strong feelings for ramen, so I probably won't recommend getting ramen here unless you really want to, after all, there are a lot of ramen restaurants in the Bay Area I'd rather visit. After the ramen, we were still waiting for 4 dishes: Albacore Tuna Tataki, Wasabi Tako, Crazy Spider Roll, and Dragon Horse Roll. We asked the server to check our orders. Twice. And the second time, when he came to check with us... Server: How's the food? How are you doing? Me: We are still waiting for 4 dishes Server: Oh? Did you order with me? Me: Yeah I saw you writing the orders on the notepad :) Server: Ahh okay let me check  He came back and said the system had a problem--blah blah blah--he was sorry and he will fix this. Fine. So we let him know we'd like to get Albacore Tuna Tataki, Wasabi Tako, Crazy Spider Roll, and Dragon Horse Roll. Meanwhile, we were waiting for food, and a server started to clean up our table, we had to stop her to take our plates and chopsticks away when she grabbed one set from us, and politely told her that we were still waiting for food. My friend asked for a clean plate and a pair of chopsticks since hers were taken away. Those never came so she just grabbed the clean ones from the table (no guests) next to us. Finally, the missing dishes were served: Wasabi Tako, Crazy Spider Roll, and Dragon Horse Roll... wait, where is Albacore Tuna Tataki?! We asked the server again, and after 15 mins, we decided let's just give up. So we told another server to cancel that dish and we want to get the check.  Patiently waiting... for another 15 mins... asked multiple servers to get our check and at this point, we just want to leave. I got the check and guess what? We were double charged with Wasabi Tako, Crazy Spider Roll, Dragon Horse Roll, and the Albacore Tuna Tataki that never show up! I knew I cannot trust our server, who knows how long is it going to take and my girlfriend was complaining that our server touched her shoulder twice while talking to us, which made her really uncomfortable. The same server touched my shoulder when I asked him about the missing orders. I also saw him touch a new customer's back when they came in. Weird.  I walked straight to the bartender who seemed to be the manager here and told him everything. He quickly updated the check and apologized for the inconvenience. He offered a 10% discount for the next time. 20% gratitude was included (by default) in the check. Honestly, we were not very happy with the experience but it was that one server's fault so it was not fair for the whole house."

        "Cameron D.": "Me and my friend came here on a whim after eating dinner. My friend came across this place on yelp when she was looking for something else and was intrigued by the Dragon Cup (and eventually Dragon Chalice) that they served their drinks in. Dragon Horse is a sushi & cocktail bar that just recently opened.  Getting to Dragon Horse is kind of an adventure, especially if you're going at night. The place is located on Folsom, so it can be kind of hard to find parking if you're driving around there. We were lucky to find some street parking not too far from the place but it definitely took a little while. Luckily, the place is open really late, so you might have a better chance of finding parking at night.  The ambiance in there is really neat. A review mentioned that its a gorgeous place and it really is. The interior is really nice to look at with some art drawings (of Dragons of course) and some a nice Japanese style its going for that it definitely executes very well. The place is super clean as well. It may be due to the fact that there isn't a whole lot of traffic there right now, but I am impressed by how nice everything looked. They also played some nice music too, which wasn't too loud so I was able to talk to my friend pretty easily.  We only had one drink called the Mogura (which contains gin). The drink was honestly really good and I could definitely see myself getting another one. I'm glad that it wasn't too sweet either, to avoid any hangover that it could've caused (though there wasn't really a lot of liquor in there to begin with).  Can't really say much about the food though since we didn't have any of it, but maybe we'll go back there someday to try it. I definitely want to try the drink thats in that Dragon Chalice that I saw in the yelp photos along with all the other drinks someday.  Overall, I'm giving this place 4 stars (pending the food) for now. Perhaps someday, I'll be able to give it a more proper rating, but I definitely recommend coming here if you wanna try their drinks and for the unique experience!"

        "Jenny L.": "An awesome new cocktail bar with food. The staff is super nice and friendly. Darn forgot to take a picture of the menu, but it's so new the cocktail drinks aren't even named yet  Ambience 5/5: Very clean, spacious, jazzy music. Music isn't too loud, so it can be intimate. This place is suitable for one person, couples , or a whole group. Drinks 5/5: The drink menu is not fully done yet, and the names of the cocktail is literally #1, #2, #3. Anyways everything we ordered was delicious, my favorite is the peppermint green drink I don't remember then number. Grrr but it's the one where there's peppermint in there, super refreshing and delicious. They can make you other drinks too. Glad to find another bar with sophisticated cocktails. Food 4/5: I ordered the beef tongue which was very very tender, cooked to perfection. I also got some chicken karaage, typical nothing special. Still room to improve but good for munching and drinking.  Service 5/5: Top notch service, really nice bartender and owner. Easy to get someone's attention. They make good recommendations. Drinks were quickly made.  Definitely recommend to go and I will go back again when it's more complete, but as of now they have something good going. Also parking situation is a little hard but there are parking lots, but I recommend ubering here."

LISTEN.  i don't know what magic they sprinkle on that burger but it was perfection. cheesy, meaty goodness. the bun was the right amount of chewy. all the flavors together harmonized in every bite.  seriously, go for the drinks, go for snacks, go for a full meal.

        "Alice S.": "I've walked by this place a couple of times and finally decided to give it a try for brunch. Walking in, I was greeted with superb service and immediately got seated. Food here is served tapas style (small shareable plates), and there's a Mexican and Spanish twist on some classic brunch food items. The price point here ($50+ per person, 18% automatic service charge) is a bit higher than for a casual brunch spot.  My partner and I started off with some brunch cocktails...because why not? He's a mezcal guy and got the Copa Faro, and I ordered the Coffee Grinder (espresso martini). The Coffee Grinder was delicious and creamy! We both agreed the Coffee Grinder was the better of the two.  For food, we shared the rock cod ceviche, Copas smashburger with double smash patty, and churros. The ceviche was the star of the show and exceptionally tasty! The churros were soft, airy, and tasted delicious dipped in chocolate. However, we both agreed that we regretted ordering the smashburger because it tasted bland, and portions were small. The \"fried\" baby potatoes that came with the burger were soft and mushy, not fried and crispy as I had hoped.  Overall, I had a pretty good brunch experience at Copas, with the exception of the burger. I'd come back again to try the happy hour and dinner menus!"

Our server was amazing and so helpful and gave us a lot of tips and time to decide what we wanted. We ended up taking all of her recommendations and im glad we did!  The food they have here is a play on what we're already familiar with, but with their own twist. The corn ravioli was such an interesting concept to us but it was so much better than we thought it would be. It was on the sweeter side, but the sauce paired really well. The gnocchi was also amazing and super soft but had a nice chew. I just wish their bread was free, but otherwise, a really good place to visit for a nice but casual dinner/lunch!"

You'll find yourself meeting the owner, being embraced by the lovely staff and learning about the local artist on display as soon as you walk in the door.  The owner had told me that Copas means cup, but another translation is 'suit of hearts in a deck of cards.' Spending time with family and friends playing cards is one of her fondest memories. At Copas they believe that 'creativity is at the heart of what we do' and you'll taste exactly what they mean with every dish! Some of my favorites were 1) lobster butter mashed potatoes 2) homemade churros 3) levain bread 4) pulpo  Create food memories Isabelle"

        "Patrick S.": "Copas serves a great Mexican twist on brunch that is worth checking out if you are in the Castro area. After a grueling workout, my friends and I were ready to eat! Within walking distance of the gym, Copas turned out to be perfect - close and delicious! Named after a Spanish suite of cards, Copas' brunch menu was filled with Spanish/Mexican dishes that were both refined but comforting. Here is the few things that I ordered: The Runny Egg Sandwich - very much enjoyed this spin on a classic egg sandwich! Not only did it have a silky scrambled eggs, it also came with a soft boiled egg so that the yolk added an extra layer of creaminess. With the serrano ham and mixture of sauces on the side added some punches of flavor that made this really great! Fried Chicken Taco - when we went the fried chicken taco was switched from a churro to a taco! after reading all the great reviews about the churro, I was a little bummed, but I think this version was interesting. instead of a chili habanero glaze, it was a little more sweet and honey like. It came with a plate of beans and rice that would be used to make a corn taco. While this was a little messy, I felt it was a nice mix of sweet and salty. However, some of my friends who sampled thought it was a little too sweet. In terms of service, I felt was very good. The chef even came out to stop by and talk about the menu which was really quite nice. Parking is always a little difficult in the Castro area, but street parking can be found! Overall, Copas serves a Mexican/Spanish brunch menu that is worth checking out if you want something a little more than your standard fast-casual."

I've seen them pop up on the list of new SF restaurants and top brunch places that I had to give them a try. I was seated facing the kitchen when I saw them preparing the fried chicken. I knew what I was going to have. Their churro fried chicken had citrus habanero glaze and chili cinnamon sugar spiced fried dough. It's a statement dish and the skin was a great combo of sweet, spicy and crispy. The churro itself was a nice touch. It's really great but ultimately it was probably a bit much for me. We also had some levain bread and that's definitely recommended.  Service was good and with tax and tip, this is about $30 per person - it's a reasonably priced brunch and I'll definitely try them again the next time I'm in the area."

Here's what we ordered:  * Olives * Bread w/ whipped yogurt chimichuri sauce * Shishito peppers * Cheesy pillows * Mussels * Pulpo * Arroz con pollo * Short ribs * Churros  My favorite dishes were the mussels, cheesy pillows and short ribs. The flavors of the mussel dish were outstanding, I wanted to drink the sauce. The cheesy pillows were like their version of gnocchi, very light and delicious and the miso mole sauce for the short ribs was very unique. Tasted like something out of Mexico City.  The only minor ding was the chicken was slightly not cooked all the way, there was like a tiny pinkish tone towards the bone. The rice was phenomenal though.  I can't wait to go back. Yum Yum Yum."

Drink: Yogurt Soju Cocktail $15 - guys, this is a hefty sized pitcher! Not a single serving, can definitely share between 2+ people. The cocktail is very foamy, which I wasn't a fan of. Chicken: Half order $16.95 has a mix of 6 pieces of dark and white meat. Some pieces of meat were very tough, not very tender or juicy. Skin is flavorful and fried nicely. Soy garlic is sweeter than Bonchon's and Supreme is great for anyone who likes sweet hot wings that are not too spicy. FREE pickled radish cubes w/ your chicken orders."

We've tried many places, but their supreme chicken is so unique in flavor and absolutely slaps, I'm telling you. We always order half of that flavor and another half of the soy garlic, a great combination. But Odumak is not just about the fried chicken. Other highlights are the kimchi fried rice, the tteokbokki with ramen, corn cheese, and the sides. Everything we've tried has been consistently delicious and flavorful. One thing we love about Odumak is that they always have plenty of seating, and we have never had any issues with parking. The staff is SUPER friendly and helpful, and they always make us feel welcome. We appreciate their attention to customer service, which makes our dining experience even better. I love the vibe too, they are always plays Korean music and it's so fun.  Honestly, we're scared this place will get too popular one day and we won't be able to frequent it as much lol, but wow what a hidden gem of a place in SF.

The sauce was flavorful, but it had way too much batter! I felt like I was just eating fried bits for a while. The \"Magic Cheese\" Fried Chicken was honestly bland and a little dry. No cheese flavor whatsoever. + Mae-Eun Galbi-Jjim (+$6 for cheese): The short ribs weren't very tender and were pretty chewy honestly.

I think it could've used more garlic. -Gal-Bi Tang soup- it's very warming on a cold night, you can taste the coziness of the white pepper in the delicious soup -Bulgogi French fries: I would probably pass on this AMBIANCE: It's a relax vibe with Korean MV playing on the tvs. They have small to multiple bigger sized tables that seat up to 8 people.

Anyways, we ordered the Corn Cheese, Bulgogi bbq, and the Soy & Garlic Korean Fried Chicken. The Bulgogi bbq came with one bowl of rice and one small set of sides (broccoli, kimchi, and tofu), while the Soy & Garlic Korean Fried Chicken only came with a side of radish. The Corn Cheese was still sizzling hot when it got to our table and that was fun to watch. It also gave the corn a nice cheese pull! The Korean Fried Chicken was crispy and had a good amount of sauce on it, and the flavor was good. The Bulgogi bbq was both of our favorite item we got that day! They gave a huge portion of the bulgogi that we ended up ordering a second bowl of rice later on! Both of our meat orders were tender and not overcooked. I'd recommend this place! Even though I initially had a bad experience because of the slow service in the beginning, everything else was good! Everything tasted good and they give big portions here, so that was nice. Other people who came in after us looked just as confused about where to wait to get seated too, so it wasn't just us."

The salmon was cooked beautifully where it was soft to the touch with a slight crunch on the outside. Combined with the Ratatouille, this dish packed a punch full of flavors and richness. We are talking about the tomatoes, onions, zucchini, and even what I believe was jam on the side of the plate. This combination left me asking for more with its savor!  I am surprised by how the presentation matched the quality of this dish. It is difficult at times to find a place that could do both.

Upon my arrival, the same server showed the same attentiveness. The brunch menu is fairly simple with enough options to choose from. My friend and I split a Florentine Benedict and a Frisco Scramble, both were delicious, not overly greasy, quality ingredients, and overall tasty.  I've already raved about their great service. The ambiance is nice too, a bit on the smaller side as the maximum capacity of the restaurant is probably less than 30. They have a big open kitchen, which you have to walk through to get to the restroom. I found that slightly odd because I felt as if I was disturbing the chefs by walking through.  Overall, give this place a try. I see that they have a special menu for dinner and looking forward to trying Cauliflower at night. #42/2022"

Speaking of everything else: we split a lovely Creme Brulee! We look forward to trying the Bread Pudding, and of course, the rest of the menu. Service was warm, inviting and quick without being rushed. Prices are fair and inline with the neighborhood. They open at 8:30 am on Sunday! One of the staff said they may also do smaller late night dining. We shall see. In anycase I recommend without hesitation."

They have a large selection of draft beer, so I got the \"Hello Sexy\" , which was pretty good! Then I got the SF Style Wurst which is this delicious sausage served on a French roll with amazing toppings. It came quick and hot! So good. Finally, I had the pretzels with two dips: beer cheese (my favorite) and spicy mustard.  The staff were also so nice and gave great recommendations. It was the perfect lunch in Duboce. Highly recommend!"

I had a free afternoon and decided to go for lunch today since it's been a while AND because I've yet to find a sandwich like the holy schnitzel. It's simple but the combination of flavors is just so good. The fries are always on point and I got a shandy today which was refreshing on an unusually warm day.  You order through a QR code (Toast) and the guy working the front of the house was friendly and fast, I never had to wait too long for my order. It was fairly quiet, someone had a laptop out (working presumably) and there was something on the TV but I've yet to be here when it's uncomfortably loud. I'm not a beer lover but I can always find something I enjoy on their menu."

The slightly California style and mostly authentic Bavarian food was awesome and the beers from Black Hammer helped wash it down. The space is super cool and they were even bird friendly which is a huge plus for my buddy Simon!  I got a plate with two sausages served with warm potato salad and cooked red cabbage. It was awesome! I had the weisewurst and Thuringer bratwurst. They were both really good. The potato salad is why I say the style is slightly California, they were like authentic warm potato salad but then it was flat top grilled to eat a bit more like country potatoes you would get at a diner. Really good but different.  The beers were all great, aside from the German styles they also had some sours and west coast IPA's. I would come back just for the beers but the food was awesome too! You should check this place out!"

They also have a ton of different condiments/sauces (our favorites were the honey mustard and curry ketchup). We also got the cider which was fine but we are not big beer drinkers but we heard from others there that they had great beer. Overall great experience with great food. We will be back!"

        "Ed U.": "Willkommen! Bienvenue! Welcome! Life is a cabaret, old chum, but it would probably be more accurate to say life here looks like a bro hangout. I think the intent was to turn the cavernous space into an indoor beer garden with at least ten German-style beers on tap from Black Hammer Brewing. That should satisfy the hipster crowd as all I saw were young males and their brewskis. I'm not much of a beer drinker, which is primarily why I haven't been in here before. That and that pesky COVID. I was lured in by their currywurst menu item, the $12 Berliner. Listen, if you ever visit Berlin (and you should), you'll find out the most popular fast food there is currywurst. The place to get it there is Curry 36 where they serve chopped pork sausage doused in a sauce made of curry powder and ketchup. All of it is placed on top of a pile of fries, and you pick the food up with a toothpick (review: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3jr7QkL&s=b629ca176e6341c9f8d6e3d1fb6b069c645d72a77656b7897da8b8248085c76a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3jr7QkL</a>). I know it sounds like a junk food mess, but it was pretty delicious. Here I found the Berliner kind of meh as the sausage was lukewarm and the equally lukewarm fries were overwhelming in quantity (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3OW6360&s=9850d14858f54fe56d54f48060cc96ce9569782443a317b5bc40a74a7c783147\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/3OW6360</a>). It did have a big toothpick, so they got that part right. I probably needed one of their beers to wash it down, but I wasn't in the mood to drink alone and settled for a Diet Coke. Hey, maybe it takes two bros to eat it all because I left most of the fries alone. FOOD - 3 stars...a currywurst that just didn't deliver the goods AMBIANCE - 4 stars...definitely a party space if that's your mood SERVICE - 3 stars...not really memorable TOTAL - 4 stars...where is the cabaret, mein herr?

        "James D.": "Was excited to try Buddy as a pre-dinner spot in the Mission. The vibe inside was nice! It was quaint and definitely had that wine bar vibe. We didn't try any of the wines here, but the menu looked good. Instead, we indulged in some of the food items and they were spectacular. We ordered the Whitefish Tonnato, which is Buddy's take on the whole tin fish and crackers movement that is happening right now. The flavors on this are out of this world! We couldn't get enough of the egg paired with the cheese and other flavors. Next up was the Roasted Trumpet Mushrooms. The mushrooms they use are especially meaty and come with this delicious truffle honey and feta sauce. The sauce alone stole the show. We enjoyed the sauce so much that we ended up ordering the bread and butter. The porcini apple butter that they used was great! It definitely held the apple taste. The bread made for a good vessel for the rest of the trumpet mushrooms sauce. Would love to come back to Buddy to try their wine and enjoy some more of their delicious food!"

      {
        "Dylan G.": "Great vibe, delicious wine and cocktail list, but the food menu was miss after miss. We started with the Bread and Butter. No butter here; instead, a pecorino doused apple glaze - low on apple and flavor. We struggled in particular with the Whitefish tonnato, which was also covered in cheese (with fish?) and a soft egg with spicy red sauce. The \"Shrooms\" dish felt was reachy -- with unnecessary goat cheese and clashing cacophony of flavors and textures. The beans and greens helped soften the blows, so long as you're not too averted to salt.  All in all, the wine sang beautifully, and we truly enjoyed ourselves in the space. While we personally struggled through the concept and execution of 5 out of 6 dishes, we'd come back for for more wine and cocktails, and to try a new and updated menu."

        "Jamie S.": "Really enjoyed dining at Buddy! They have a small menu so probably best for smaller groups (unless you want repeats of items). Between 2 people, we shared 4 dishes and dessert which felt like the right amount of food. Started things off with the nonalcoholic plum spritz which was delicious! Would recommend it as an alternative to wines - sophisticated and tasty. Stone fruit & early girls - delicious and would highly recommend. I'm a sucker for early girls while they're in season, and the smoked goat cheese on this dish was pleasantly mild, almost labneh like in consistency. The basil and olive oil garnishes were fantastic Brentwood sweet corn - the corn was cooked perfectly, but the highlight of this dish undoubtedly was the blueberry miso sauce  Butter beans - simple but hearty, with a nice well done breadcrumb garnish (these are usually very hit or miss for me!) and finished with a good helping of lemon zest Trumpet mushrooms - probably my favorite dish (!) was too excited to eat it so didn't get a pic. Love what they described as a \"Mexican chili crisp\" as the sauce on this Chocolate brownie - solid finish to the meal! Well balanced chocolate with flakey salt Great place for non-obvious vegetarian dishes, which can be sometimes hard to come by!"

        "Vivian T.": "Wanted some small dishes and had some time to spare before another dinner. We discovered Buddy's walking around after golfing and decided to try to walk in. They had reservations later in the evening so we were on a time limit. We got a few things to try: Gougeres (4/5): I would describe this as a savory cream puff! It comes in two and is topped with trout roe that gives it a smoky salmon flavor. These were very small but delicious. La Gilda Dip (4/5): A very savory dip served with a handful of crostinis. My first bite was incredibly salty so the less the better! It is a layered dip with olives, anchovy, peppers, black currant, and cream cheese.  Halibut Crudo (5/5): This was a gorgeous dish! The watermelon rinds tasted like radish and resembled some sort of pickled veggie. The halibut was incredibly soft.  FLOWERHEAD Chamomile Tea (5/5): This tea was an amazing pair to the savory dishes and was actually perfect for the meal considering we didn't want to drink.  Service was friendly and attentive. Such a cute restaurant for date night or catching up with friends. Really glad I stumbled upon Buddy's!"

        "Maureen W.": "Super cute place to grab a drink & some small bites for a date or with friends! Came on a Saturday evening (with a reservation) ~6:30pm and the place was packed throughout the entire night. The place has a really great atmosphere - Felt relaxed like a neighborhood wine bar with nice decor and friendly service. There wine menu was a bit smaller than expected but have heard that they rotate the selection frequently. Food was super delicious, with great presentation and some really unique flavors. Would definitely recommend getting the Roasted Trumpet Shrooms - So much flavor punched into one dish with a perfect combo of sweet, spicy, and savory. Also would give an A+ to the service. They noticed our dips were low on crostinis and offered to bring out more. Appreciated the attention to detail and, overall, enjoyed our night here."

        "Priscilla U.": "Stopped by this place to the Alamo Draft House for a quick drink but ended up eating an entire meal. Super delicious!  Starting off with, when is a great time to come here? Honestly, any time. They have such a great drink selection and the food menu looked so unique and amazing. They had bar seating and a few 2-4 person tables inside. I would definitely come here again for dinner or a date. Next, let's talk about the food & drinks: I was initially excited about the wine glass until I saw their cocktails. I love trying out different milk punch from different places because they're always made so uniquely. This one was super well balanced and one of the better ones I've had. Most of the spirit forward drinks comes out in a cute tea glass. Initially surprised that there was a kitchen, I was blown away at the type of food there was. We saw at the bar facing the kitchen so we ended up getting multiple dishes. Here were my favorites: Brentwood sweet corn -- I've never had corn prepared like this and it was so good, the blueberry miso really gave it an extraordinary umami flavor. Roasted Trumped Shrooms -- Whenever there's mushrooms as an app, I have to get it. These shrooms were prepared like nothing I've ever had before. The truffle on it almost crystalized into the mushroom making it taste like a creme brulee. I loved it! Overall, absolutely love this place to dine & drink, hoping the menu grows more so I can try more items on the menu!"

I am not personally a fan of the coffee roast as it tends to be more on the bitter end. That being said they still have great flavor.  I also recommend getting a pastry as they have some really high quality pastries. For example we got the chocolate twist but I've personally tried their sticky buns and have also loved it.

The cafe has a good number of tables with seats, inside and outside (there are heaters outside), so that's super nice. Not sure if they have wifi and I couldn't see any outlets either. The drinks are very reasonably price. My americano was a bit under $4, wouldn't say it's the best americano I've had but was okay. I got hungry later and ordered fries which was also $3.50, which is a great price. Haven't tried their food yet but would highly recommend this place if you need to get work done!"

I went with the chilaquiles and an iced americano. Other items that sounded good: shakshuka, aa bowl, bacon, breakfast burrito, kale and quinoa salad. Ordered at the front, picked up a number for the table and waited for my coffee before heading outside to the table where we awaited for the introduction to our food.  There were plenty of seats inside and out, but just was there during rush hour where most tables were being used. We were lucky to score a table outside since dining outdoors near the street was really enjoyable. I felt like I was eating at a cafe somewhere else.

My experiences at both locations were very similar though when waiting in line you hear rich people talking about their lives. When I was at this location while waiting in line to order my coffee, these two women in their late 20's were talking and one was talking about how she walked up to these people and asked if they could buy their house. And the two women were joking about it like 'oh, I'm sure I looked so silly walking up and asking to buy their house, but haha.\" It was just an example of privilege front and center, as the middle class certainly doesn't have experiences like that. I ordered an Oat Milk Latte and it tasted pretty good, but nothing I would go out of my way to seek out again. They also had people order at the counter and then take it to-go or sit inside since indoor dining was open. I would come back if I was already in the immediate area to get coffee or next year to update my review."

Despite the other comments I saw regarding rude staff, I thought they were pretty friendly.  Yogurt bowl was a big portion, could've shared between 2 people. Had tiny pieces of cacao which I forgot was even an ingredient because the other flavors really overpowered the tiny bit. The matcha latte was really good, one of the better ones I've had in the city. I always order matcha with no sweetener, I remember their Nob Hill location premixed sugar in their matcha powder but at this location I asked again and they said they don't add sweetener."

They made my whole experience wonderful and I would go back just to drink wine and chat.  FOOD: Comfort French dishes. I loved the small menu, the wine had gems.

I've tried most appetizers(except two), all burger options, most main dishes(except group beef), mussels with all flavors, and some crepes and paninis. Where do I even start? - I love their onion soup--perfect for windy SF weather. - The mussels with different flavors are phenomenal as I tried all of them, and my favorite one is with the Poulette flavor. - Crepes!!! It's perfect for sunny day brunch in SF. The ones with mushrooms or smoked salmon are my picks. - Nicoise salad, You can't go wrong with it. Nicely seasoned anchovies and seared tuna enhanced the flavor. - Duck confit: Gotta try! So soft and melts in your mouth. ***Some stuff to know: - Cozy space with outdoor seating available. - Walk-in only: Having lunch during the weekdays doesn't require waiting but expect to wait for prime dinner time(6-9ish pm). It can easily take up to 1hr wait. Once you arrive, you put your name down on the whiteboard if you see people waiting. - Bread(with butter): it used to be complimentary, but not anymore. But please feel free to request a refill once you order it. Olive oil and vinegar are available upon request."

And the 2$ bread and butter is so worth because dipping the bread in this is even better.  Pork chop- 4.5/5 even though I had it cooked medium rare there were nuts that were a tad dry. Overall sauce was bomb and the Brussels were amazing.  The carbonera was good. Standard. Not amazing. Not terrible.  The fettuccine was a little too heavy on the wine taste for my liking.  French fries are always a solid choice and the brussel sprouts were very well done - flavor great. Not super crispy though if that's your thing.  Duck cotnfiet is always a good option. I'd skip the crepes (I wasn't a huge fan of the salmon crepe)  Since I've been here 3 times now : Must get: Les Moules Poulette with fried if you like muscles French onion soup Duck confit Mac and cheese if you like Mac n cheese  Maybe- pork chop, pastas, beef tartar Meh on the burger (it doesn't come with much so if you get it as is - it's pretty bland)"

Food was incredible. Flavorful, rich, balanced, and generous portions. We were starving and ordered several things to share. The standouts for me were the warm goat cheese salad and veal.

The sauce was delicious - to be honest it wasn't the best dish of mussels I had ever had (possibly comparing unfairly to fresh catches ocean-side) but delicious either way. Enjoyed sopping up the soup with the house bread, but would probably take the recommendation on fries on the next visit :) My friend had the fettuccini carbonara which tasted AMAZING. We shared a dessert of salted caramel and pecan (? hoping my memory serves me well) sorbet, and a nutella banana crepe. Will be back! Thanks Olivier!

Thank you Chez Maman East staff for making our evening so special."

The menu has a little of everything, you'll find something you like for sure. I had the Roasted duck confit with potatoes gratin, haricot vert, port reduction. It was sooo goood! The potates had too much garlic for my taste but I still liked them. The Viognier was good. I had a glass of that wine and Sancerre with dessert. For dessert, I had the Cinnamon pain perdu with marinated fresh berries, maple syrup, chantilly. Yummm, lovely way to finish dinner. My friend had the Tarte Tatin. It was so good! Warm desserts are the best during cold months. The decor is cute. Plenty of space outside and some tables inside. The restroom was clean. Service was attentive and very friendly. We had a wonderful time, merci."

Two people shared two apps, a main and a dessert, it was the perfect amount of food. I prefer octopus to have a tiny bite, but the flavor was spot on, the polenta was crisp, the beef was delicious.

        "Nirshiee A.": "I absolutely loved this place. I had such a great experience here. My friend chose this spot for dinner and of course I said yes since I love tapas style places. We did the three course tasting menu.  For my appetizer I got theSalt Cod Fritters and my friend got the Wine Braised Octopus. Both were delicious. I really liked the cilantro aoli sauce that the cod came with. For our entres we both got the Arroz De Marisco. The flavor was so good, it had fish, oysters and shrimp in the dish. At first I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it since I was already pretty full from the appetizer, but it was so good that I was able to finish it all. For dessert I tried the passionfruit mousse and just like the first two courses this did not disappoint. It was probably the most amazing mousse dessert I've had. The flavors were impeccable, and I loved the graham cracker shavings that were inside. The ambiance is super nice with dim lighting. We had great service. I would definitely come back here."

        "Angel Y.": "SUPER cute place that is for sure underrated in SF. Service is attentive but not stuffy. The only thing I docked off for is that its pretty pricey even for SF for what you get ($180 for two tax and tip) We got the 3 course prix fixe and I would say that the portions are generous but some of the dishes did not have the flavorful restaurant quality but instead tasted a bit plain. The Polenta was just a big hard triangle in a pile of mushrooms and I do think the short rib was dry and definitely needed more sauce. However, dessert hit it out of the park!"

        "Soo J S.": "We came here for restaurant week. The menu has good choices for first, second, and third course. Service was great and did not take forever. The staff were also very friendly! From the first course, we really recommend the shrimp turnover (Rissole de camarao) and the sausage dish with Jorge cheese. For the second course, we really recommend the frango piri piri, and the clam and pork in tomato soup. For desert, you have to get the orange olive oil cake and the famous egg tart. Portions were also good and worth the price!"

        "Bob K.": "Really solid spot in Noe Valley serving what seems like authentic Portuguese food in a really cool environment. Went for the three course tasting and really enjoyed the octopus - wasn't expecting it to be cold but it was really excellent. Shrimp croquettes were mostly bready and a bit disappointing. Duck sous vide was almost no duck on top of a big croquette and so the proportions seemed off although overall it was good. Pork shoulder was excellent. Lots of clams and lots of pork. Super flavorful. Olive oil orange cake with citrus was a fantastic dessert. Really good and glad to know they're there."

        "Amy S.": "Delicious Portuguese food! Their prix fixe menu is a pretty good value -- I came with a friend and we each ordered 3 courses ($55pp), so between the two of us we got to sample 6 courses of food. We were absolutely stuffed by the end and very satisfied! The food was a bit hit or miss, but I'd absolutely return for the hits. We made a reservation in advance though I don't think it was necessary since customers were quite light that evening (maybe because it was a Wednesday night?). FOOD The only restriction for the prix fixe ordering structuring is that you can only order maximum one entree per person, but other than that you can customize where in the menu you choose your other 2 courses from. My friend and I ended up ordering 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert between the two of us, which in my opinion was the best split. Salada de Polvo (3/5) - This app was a definite miss. There was a paltry number of octopus pieces and mostly black eyed peas. The octopus pieces were tasty but neither of us wanted to fill up on beans in the first course. Gambas Mocambique (5/5) - Shrimp was juicy and sauce was wine-y, tomato-y, and just delicious. Best part is the server came back and offered us more grilled bread pieces to sop up the remaining sauce! Pasteis de Bacalhau (5/5) - Normally when a fritter is X ingredient and potato filling (in this case salted cod), the X is lacking and the filling is almost always mostly potato. In this case, the salted cod made up such a majority I almost forgot there was potato in this at all until I looked at the menu again! Cripsy, and the cilantro aioli was a delicious pairing. Arroz de Marisco (5/5) - You have to order this!!! If you get nothing else I suggest, at least order this one. This was soupier in texture than a risotto or paella, probably closer to a seafood congee. The fish, clams, and shrimp inside were tender and juicy, and the rest of the rice was deliciously seasoned and a bit sour from the tomato. We absolutely cleaned this out, it was so good. Carne de Porco a Alentejana (4/5) - This one was also a bit of a miss, mostly because the braised pork shoulder needed more time and was still kind of hard and chewy. The sauce was delicious, but I think if I took this home and pressure cooked it for 10 more minutes it would've been perfect. Pudim Flan (4/5) - Delicious! Though a bit single-noted so it got kind of tiresome to eat towards the end. The flan isn't super soft but rather a dense, thick texture that weighs heavily on your stomach.  PARKING Since Uma Casa is deep in Noe Valley parking isn't much of a problem. Plenty of residential street parking in the area."

I've been craving raw marinated crab for a while so I came with my family on a Saturday afternoon and got seated almost immediately. We were very hungry so we ordered a lot of food.  An order of crabs comes with 3 (6 halves) raw crabs so we got two orders and they were a fan favorite! Even my mom who doesn't like raw food thought the crab was marinated well and great with rice.  We also got the double fried chicken wings (garlic), reg jjampong, seafood jjampong, jajangmyeon, sweet and sour pork, and salt & pepper fish fillet. Jajangmyeon is usually one of my fav dishes but it was a bit lacking in flavor so we will prob skip next time."

Right after we were seated, there were many people waiting outside for their turn. We tried many items and everything was amazing. I've heard about spicy raw crab and it was my first time trying it. You get gloves because it does get messy. Eat it with the seaweed and rice they provide. We also tried the jajang mein, chicken wings, sweet and sour pork, and honey walnut shrimp. Staff was friendly and service was quick. The second time I went with my coworkers on a Wednesday and the spicy raw crab did sell out after we were finished eating. I've ordered take out as well and everything is packaged well in vacuum sealed containers. Such a great addition to the neighborhood and will definitely have to order for lunch since it is just blocks away from my job and home."

I would recommend it only if you can tolerate spice well - I'm a spice lover, but could only handle eating a few pieces before I had to drown out the spice with noodles lol."

Ordered Spicy Raw Crab - comes with rice and package seaweed Eggplant with Garlic sauce Double Fried Chicken Wings (Honey Chili) This is the first time I have ever had Spicy Raw Crab from a restaurant. It was so good, that soft meat and the sweet spicy sauce. It's so different from grocery store ones. I now understand from all the Mukbangs that I watch on Youtube, why it's so good.  The double fried chicken wings had good flavor. We will probably dine in next time, so that the chicken doesn't become soggy from the container. Eggplant was tender and not too oily."

The noodles usually are supposed to be hand pulled but doesn't seem like they are here.  The black bean noodles were good, the sauce wasn't overly sweet or salty.  The shrimp fried rice was satisfying and hearty.  The double fried chicken wings could use more sauce but weren't bad. By no means are they comparable to San Tung. Decent portion size. 1 restroom and 1 TV Extra star for giving a mini bag of Haribo gummy bears. You don't get that at any other Asian restaurants. Parking is tough in the area."

The spicy raw crab is DELICIOUS. The crab marinade is sooo tasty! It's spicy and sweet with vegetables to add to the texture and flavor. The crab itself was super buttery. I was afraid at first, but after a taste, it's one of the best things I've tried. They give a bowl of rice, a bag of seaweed, and box of gloves for you to use. The double fried chicken is also definitely a star of the show-- another one of my new favorites. The chicken isn't as crispy as other places, but this honestly doesn't bother me at all because the flavor on point. The chicken is coated in a sticky garlic sauce, which has a strong and pleasant garlic taste. It's tender and not oily! The jajang mein and jjamppong are also good stable choices. The jajang mein has a great black bean flavor with lots of vegetables. The jjamppong had lots of veggies, which I absolutely love. It's not crazy spicy, so you can actually taste the soup base. The seafood jjamppong also comes with a small half of a crab.  A little far from me, but worth the trip!"

        "Jessica J.": "My friend and I both had our eyes on this place for awhile because of their spicy raw crab. She wanted to compare to a spot in the South Bay.  We ordered 3 items under their \"specialities\" section: the spicy raw crab, jajang mein, and double fried chicken wings.  The crab was obviously the most notable dish. It comes with a bowl of rice and a pack of seaweed and they provide disposable gloves. Prepare to get messy! The other two dishes were classic comfort foods, nothing special. The jajang mein was overcooked for our liking, but the chicken wings were yummy and the portion was generous.  Given the current hype, we were a little underwhelmed by the overall experience. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think it's worth coming back for just one notable dish. My friend also noted she prefers the South Bay spot because they execute other menu items well, too."

It's messy so make sure to not wear your nicest shirt if you're clumsy like me..I made a makeshift bib from a napkin HAHA. They give plenty of gloves too. The dish also comes with rice and seaweed (The snacking kind). The crab texture tastes like a super soft fish. Don't be scared to try it!!  The jjajangmyeon was a big portion split between my friend and I as well. The noodles had the perfect texture and consistency. They also didn't skimp on the black bean sauce..we still had a lot left after we finished the noodles!  The green beans were also another hit! Crunchy, fresh, garlicy..I definitely would pick this dish if you want to add some veggies to your meal.  I would order all three of these dishes again the next time I'm here!"

My lesser *'d review This time I ordered the NOR-CAL Burrito: Served With Your Choice of Meat, Crispy Potatoes, Beans, Pico De Gallo, Sour Cream, Cheese and Guacamole - $15 Let me 1st say the size of the burrito is enormous. I so appreciated the tortilla had been grilled 1st before filling it. Therefore making it and the ingredients piping hot upon 1st bite. The ingredients of this burrito was less than flavorful - IMP. I chose the grilled chicken as my protein. I should say it was rather flavorless and this is what I experienced on my 1st visit. At one point I thought, is there any Sour Cream, Cheese or Guacamole. So I unwrapped the burrito and was hard pressed to find any of that. The potatoes were mushy, the chicken flavorless (no grilled taste at all) and again, just a dollop (maybe) of the last three ingredients. I so wanted to love this Burrito, but for me, it was a fail. No amount of Salsa could save it, sorry. I do see they get a lot of good reviews, yeh, I'm just not one of them."

OK, it's actually not new, it's been around for a couple of years now, but hey, I never claimed to be a culinary trendsetter. After all, I was years overdue to try aa bowls, but I was at least a decade early on the Hainan chicken craze. So it evens out, I guess. Anyway, this was a good find for me finally - though ironically I went when I wasn't that hungry. Too bad because they serve whole rotisserie chickens as well as all the standard gluttonous items you'd expect from a taqueria. I ordered the $17.95 La Campesina Ensalada with of course, pieces of rotisserie chicken thrown in. What arrived was a mighty hearty bowl of romaine lettuce, pumpkin seeds, corn, black beans, radish and pico de gallo. It came topped with fresh avocado slices and grated cotija cheese, the whole salad was tossed in their housemade epazote cilantro dressing, very creamy (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F381eSeA&s=2f6f7b48d33261156f4b6097dcff6c29cfaef177a2f63dbbc37b7f9cc859ce8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/381eSeA</a>).

Rotisserie Chicken w/ Corn Tortillas: You basically get an entire rotisserie chicken, fresh off the rotisserie. It's been marinated in tons of Mexican spaces, so way more interesting than that bland Safeway rotisserie chicken. It's cut in half and covered in pickled red onions and cilantro. Comes with a few corn tortillas so you can assemble your own tacos from freshly shredded chicken (white meat or dark meat, you pick), pickled onions, cilantro and a bunch of salsas from the salsa bar. Personally, I like the smoky salsa the most, but the salsa verde is nice too. Half the chicken was filling enough for two grown men, so took the half for leftovers."

The glass noodles are always cooked perfectly. This time when I did take out, the sauce was a lot more salty than usual, so I guess the taste can vary somewhat.  - Roti pratha - curry sauce is similar to the yellow curry that is in the singapore curry noodle, but with that delicious flaky roti!! Honestly getting this and the Beef Rendang together is perfect :) - Beef Rendang - another favorite of mine, so simple with just rice and the meat but so satisfying. I would suggest ordering something else to go with it as it is a smaller portion and doesn't have much variety of texture or flavor within the dish itself."

        "Elaine S.": "Stopped by w no reservations on a Friday evening. The space is cozy w strong Tokyo mom and pop shop vibes. They have a nice selection of apps you don't commonly see such as Ikura Oroshi, and r most well known for their house made tofu.  I'd come back but order the sashimi regular instead w a bowl of rice. I love fish and found the chirashi to be thinner slices than I'd prefer w lots of rice. Rice was good tho!  The gyoza tasted very home made. The texture was softer than store bought and flavor was good. Savory soft was ultra pudding like and the sauce b minced ginger was nice  Ikura oroshi was a bit underwhelming. I love ikura and I learn I prefer it on its own than with daikon.  Chirashi ($26): 9 pieces of thin cut fish with lots of sushi rice.  Sushi Regular ($24) 7 piece nigiri w tells maki Sashimi Regular ($24) 9 piece thick sashimi cuts. 4 types of fish.  Ikura Oroshi ($9.5): Salmon roe w grated daikon  Gyoza ($8.5)  Edamame ($5) House made ankake tofu ($6.5): home made soft tofu w ginger and sticky sweet sauce on top"

The fish is fresh and cut the way it's supposed to be cut (unlike so many U.S. sushi places that dumb it down). But the star here is the mochi. I've been told to try the tofu, so I'll be back for that next time."

        "Rachel M.": "It's refreshing to experience a traditional Japanese restaurant in the Castro. The establishment is pretty tiny and could only fit a small volume of customers- we ended up sitting outside and our server put a heater on the bottom to combat the normally cooler SF evening. The menu has a variety of items and we ordered some unique traditional dishes including sesame spinach, mackerel (Saba) with bitter melon, 2 types of homemade tofu: hot and cold, the regular sushi chef special with 7 pieces of nigiri and a tuna roll, house made gyoza, rainbow/ dragon rolls, and a large hot sake. We enjoyed the homemade tofu, gyoza, and mackerel- they were tasty, flavorful and comforting. The nigiri was decent, but some fish didn't taste as fresh and were a bit tough. The rolls were ok, but small. I appreciated the real crab in the rolls but found a few hard crab shell pieces I had to spit out.  Prices are steeper and for 3 ppl, our bill was about $120 and we weren't that full. Good thing we had planned to get dessert afterwards. Glad to have tried it, nonetheless."

        "Jennifer C.": "Nestled next to kitchen story, Eiji is a cute little Japanese restaurant with delicious homemade food. Seating caps out at 5 people. The staff speak Japanese to each other - a very authentic restaurant with sushi, fish, among other entrees. My go-tos are the seaweed salad, homemade ankake tofu, chirashi bowl, and strawberry mochi for dessert with hot tea. Both tofu and mochi are only available for dining in. I don't usually like red bean, but the light smear of it does really blend well for the strawberry mochi. Chirashi bowl is generous in fish and the sushi rice is delectably done. There's never been a wait in the times I've gone, but it's gotten pretty full with only a handful of tables. Reliably delicious and quick to serve entrees, I always stop by here on my way to u:dessert for bingsu after!"

        "Stefanie C.": "I love writing updated reviews for places I originally visited 7 years ago. That was the case for Eiji, which I've been to countless times starting in 2015. This is such a quaint and peaceful place that will satisfy any sushi craving. It's a small restaurant, so you have to get lucky sometimes with the wait. Once seats are filled up, waiting can be anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Regardless, totally worthwhile. The first time I came here, my friend ordered the Chef's Choice Deluxe Sushi Platter ($26.25) which has 11 pieces of nigiri and 1 roll. We also got the Chef's Choice Regular Sashimi ($14.25) which has 9 pieces of sashimi. This was a good amount of food for two people, and our waitress actually encouraged us to order more since the kitchen was closing. I love that they have these Chef's Choice options to save me from actually making a decision when I just really want good sushi!  This is probably some of the freshest sushi and sashimi I have ever tasted. Coming here, I would prefer eating nigiri and sashimi instead of ordering a fancier roll. Keep things simple, you know? We also had delicious hot tea and an ice cold Asahi to complement our meal. These days I just get the chirashi bowl. Overall one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. Wonderful, authentic experience. Thank you Eiji!"

        "Felicia L.": "TLDR: A very quaint spot run by a couple from Japan. The food feels homey and is absolutely delicious! I couldn't recommend this spot more. Food: 8/10 The food was absolutely amazing! I'd definitely recommend their specials and checking out the small plates. My personal favorites were the monk fish liver and you absolutely must order the mochi strawberry! It was so perfectly tart, yet sweet and had me hooked. The fish was also super fresh and delicious. Price & Portion: 6/10 The prices are pretty standard for sushi. I think we ended up paying around $50 per person (and this is including dessert). We definitely left feeling full! Service: 7/10 The service was great here! There was a bit of a wait when we went, but we just walked around the neighborhood a bit. Ambience: 8/10 The restaurant is super small and intimate feeling. It's the perfect place for a casual date or catching up with friends."

I love the food that I got today but I didn't try a lot of things. - Warm homemade tofu with the starchy sauce, a tiny bit of ginger, julienne chopped shishi and scallion. Perfect for a chilly day in SF - Hotate nigiri: fresh & good - Unagi roll with avocado and cucumber. It's so simple but very good. The avocado was creamy while cucumber was crunchy & fresh. Dessert: - homemade strawberry mochi. One order per person. I couldn't convince them to give me 2 T_T it's so goood. Not too sweet, which can be quite common with Japanese mochi. It's like the one I ate in The Big Island, Hawaii.  I will definitely come back. "

My lesser *'d review This time I ordered the NOR-CAL Burrito: Served With Your Choice of Meat, Crispy Potatoes, Beans, Pico De Gallo, Sour Cream, Cheese and Guacamole - $15 Let me 1st say the size of the burrito is enormous. I so appreciated the tortilla had been grilled 1st before filling it. Therefore making it and the ingredients piping hot upon 1st bite. The ingredients of this burrito was less than flavorful - IMP. I chose the grilled chicken as my protein. I should say it was rather flavorless and this is what I experienced on my 1st visit. At one point I thought, is there any Sour Cream, Cheese or Guacamole. So I unwrapped the burrito and was hard pressed to find any of that. The potatoes were mushy, the chicken flavorless (no grilled taste at all) and again, just a dollop (maybe) of the last three ingredients. I so wanted to love this Burrito, but for me, it was a fail. No amount of Salsa could save it, sorry. I do see they get a lot of good reviews, yeh, I'm just not one of them."

OK, it's actually not new, it's been around for a couple of years now, but hey, I never claimed to be a culinary trendsetter. After all, I was years overdue to try aa bowls, but I was at least a decade early on the Hainan chicken craze. So it evens out, I guess. Anyway, this was a good find for me finally - though ironically I went when I wasn't that hungry. Too bad because they serve whole rotisserie chickens as well as all the standard gluttonous items you'd expect from a taqueria. I ordered the $17.95 La Campesina Ensalada with of course, pieces of rotisserie chicken thrown in. What arrived was a mighty hearty bowl of romaine lettuce, pumpkin seeds, corn, black beans, radish and pico de gallo. It came topped with fresh avocado slices and grated cotija cheese, the whole salad was tossed in their housemade epazote cilantro dressing, very creamy (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F381eSeA&s=2f6f7b48d33261156f4b6097dcff6c29cfaef177a2f63dbbc37b7f9cc859ce8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/381eSeA</a>).

We ordered the carne asada tacos, machos nachos, fried fish tacos, and quesadillas. All of the food came very fast and was so filling. They had a salsa bar and the habanero salsa was my favorite! I enjoyed the nachos but like all nachos they get soggy if you let it sit for too long. I went and asked if I can purchase a side of chips so I could eat the rest of my toppings with crunchy chips and they gave me some for free!

Rotisserie Chicken w/ Corn Tortillas: You basically get an entire rotisserie chicken, fresh off the rotisserie. It's been marinated in tons of Mexican spaces, so way more interesting than that bland Safeway rotisserie chicken. It's cut in half and covered in pickled red onions and cilantro. Comes with a few corn tortillas so you can assemble your own tacos from freshly shredded chicken (white meat or dark meat, you pick), pickled onions, cilantro and a bunch of salsas from the salsa bar. Personally, I like the smoky salsa the most, but the salsa verde is nice too. Half the chicken was filling enough for two grown men, so took the half for leftovers."

Favorites: - Singapore Curry Noodle - 11/10 this is definitely my go to whenever I go to lime tree! It has such a wonderful curry flavor with chunks of chicken and mushroom! The glass noodles are always cooked perfectly. This time when I did take out, the sauce was a lot more salty than usual, so I guess the taste can vary somewhat.  - Roti pratha - curry sauce is similar to the yellow curry that is in the singapore curry noodle, but with that delicious flaky roti!! Honestly getting this and the Beef Rendang together is perfect :) - Beef Rendang - another favorite of mine, so simple with just rice and the meat but so satisfying. I would suggest ordering something else to go with it as it is a smaller portion and doesn't have much variety of texture or flavor within the dish itself."

Literally a cold piece of rubber. 2) Eggs: asked for my eggs to be over easy and they were overcooked. Looks like the chef cannot even cook an egg! 3) Potatoes: so old and bland. 4) Pickled vegetables: not even pickled. Tasted like raw vegetable with vinegar drizzled on it. 5) Chimichurri sauce: it was just olive oil with bland green particles in it. Salmon bowl was extremely bland. Rice was probably 3 days old if not more. Tiny salmon on the top was very average.  Bottom line is that this place is focused so much on the aesthetics that the food itself and the service are forgotten! I will not go there again and don't recommend it to anyone else."

Overall design sense is nice, but hard to see the nuanced style since lighting was low. It does give off a Japanese Peruvian fusion sensibility.  With the low lighting the key focus is the bar. Bar service was good and conversational, along with prompt.  Their cocktail menu wasn't overly extensive but seemed to the right quantity of choices and of course any bar that is fusion of Peru has the obligatory pisco ours. A nice surprise is they have a pretty good list of Sake's that you can choose between a glass, carafe or bottle size. And of course good sake doesn't come cheap. The cocktails and sake was just a tip of the alcohol options, you can choose from a variety of red and white wines, and Japanese import beers.  The food menu is pretty lengthy categorized small plates / appetizers, civiche, nigiri & shashimi, specially sushi rolls, skewers, entrees and side dishes. That's a lot to deftly execute! On this occasion I chose the SCALLOP TIRADITO japanese scallop which I loved and would order again. The LIMA ROLL torched shrimp tempura was a well composed roll and would recommend. I also a huge octupus fan and got the PULPO A LA PARRILLA grilled Mediterranean octopus. A must try!  With all that said, I could honestly hold hand on heart and recommend this place as good launching point to start an evening of eating and drinking."

        "Audrey F.": "A great fusion between Japanese and Peruvian flavors that is unique and cultural. I've recently been trying to going to union street and trying all the restaurants on the strip (Flores, Dumpling Union, Sacred Taco etc) and was especially impressed by this place. I was drawn to Kaiyo because I love Japanese food but have never tried Peruvian, so this would be a great start!  We started with a pisco sour and porci rosso as cocktails to get the night going and they did the job. I guess I'm not a big fan of mezcal which was strong in the porci rosso, and preferred the pisco sour which was more tart and foamy. For an app, we ordered the pork Bao buns. The flavors in the pork is where I really tasted the fusion between Japanese and Peruvian. Savory but with a sour peppery taste. The buns were a bit dry, but not a total disappointment because the contents inside where yummy. Our mains consisted of the Kaiyo Roll, A5 Wagyu & Hamachi Nigiri, and Lomo Saltado. Each main was vastly different from the last and expanded my taste palette. The Lomo Saltado was very salty to me but kept a very savory profile. The mix of the fries was very interesting as well. The sushi roll pieces were cut pretty thick and was pretty average. I still enjoyed it but I personally couldn't find it too special. The star of the show for me were the two pieces of nigiri. The freshness and craft of both the A5 Wagyu and Hamachi are amazing and delicate. I will definitely order more nigiri pieces to try the uniqueness of the others. Overall Kaiyo has glowy ambiance alongside the manga inspired walls that makes it a great place to have fun dates and good food to keep you company. Highly recommend reservations if you know you want to come here. It gets pretty loud inside so maybe not the most ideal place if you want an intimate dine in experience. I felt content after eating here, indulging in the Japanese-Peruvian cuisine!"

Honestly, I loved all the different food we had the baby octopus, the otoro uni toast, scallop tiradito, filet mignon anticucho was on point, the Lima roll and the lomo saltado rolls were superb, A5 wagyu super tasty, lastly the petite filet mignon and the shout chicken were both just perfect to go with a perfect evening with my wife. Service was great, fast, and friendly. They were very accommodating to our requests and helped us enjoy a lovely evening."

Drinks contained wrong liquor and we had to send it back. Totally understandable mistakes happen but it frustrated people in our group who were there celebrating my sisters birthday. We waited patiently for too long. The reason why I gave this three stars was the kitchen. NOT our server, he was kind and kept apologizing to our party of 10. Did the best he could so we tipped him well. Had a better experience at the rooftop location though."

But the food and drinks were okay. I returned my first order the spicy salmon it had a weird taste. Our waiter the kind gentlemen asked if I wanted to replace it so I did for the shrimp tempura it was okay. I enjoyed the edamame and furikake rice. My best friend didn't really like her veggie gyoza. We weren't really satisfied and starving still lol. We ended up calling the night early because I got sick from the food and ended up throwing up it was terrible so we won't be coming back. I've never experienced something like this before agter eating at a restaurant it sucked that this was my first time and that was the experience. I was notified aboit this place by a friend because I love sushi, but idk that to me wasn't sushi."

        "Kris R.": "Kaiyo Cow Hollow is a must-visit restaurant in San Francisco. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, with dim lighting and a warm color scheme. The menu is a fusion of Japanese and Latin American flavors, creating unique and delicious dishes that are sure to satisfy any palate. The sushi rolls at Kaiyo are top-notch. The Salmon Roll is a standout, with fresh salmon, avocado, and cucumber wrapped in rice and seaweed. The roll is perfectly balanced and the salmon is incredibly fresh. The Spicy Tuna Roll is another great option, with a spicy kick that isn't overpowering. The hot dishes at Kaiyo are equally delicious. The Octopus Skewers are a must-try, with tender and flavorful octopus served with a delicious chimichurri sauce. The Wagyu Beef Skewers are also a standout dish, with melt-in-your-mouth beef served with a tangy and spicy jalapeno sauce. In addition to the great food, Kaiyo also offers a great drink menu. The bartenders are skilled at creating unique and delicious cocktails that perfectly complement the flavors of the food. The Kaiyo Margarita was a perfect balance of sweet and sour flavors. Overall, Kaiyo Cow Hollow is a fantastic restaurant that should be on every San Francisco foodie's list. The unique and delicious fusion of Japanese and Latin American flavors, combined with the cozy atmosphere and great drinks, make for an all-around great dining experience."

They have a nice selection of apps you don't commonly see such as Ikura Oroshi, and r most well known for their house made tofu.  I'd come back but order the sashimi regular instead w a bowl of rice. I love fish and found the chirashi to be thinner slices than I'd prefer w lots of rice. Rice was good tho!  The gyoza tasted very home made. The texture was softer than store bought and flavor was good. Savory soft was ultra pudding like and the sauce b minced ginger was nice  Ikura oroshi was a bit underwhelming. I love ikura and I learn I prefer it on its own than with daikon.  Chirashi ($26): 9 pieces of thin cut fish with lots of sushi rice.  Sushi Regular ($24) 7 piece nigiri w tells maki Sashimi Regular ($24) 9 piece thick sashimi cuts. 4 types of fish.  Ikura Oroshi ($9.5): Salmon roe w grated daikon  Gyoza ($8.5)  Edamame ($5) House made ankake tofu ($6.5): home made soft tofu w ginger and sticky sweet sauce on top"

        "Rachel M.": "It's refreshing to experience a traditional Japanese restaurant in the Castro. The establishment is pretty tiny and could only fit a small volume of customers- we ended up sitting outside and our server put a heater on the bottom to combat the normally cooler SF evening. The menu has a variety of items and we ordered some unique traditional dishes including sesame spinach, mackerel (Saba) with bitter melon, 2 types of homemade tofu: hot and cold, the regular sushi chef special with 7 pieces of nigiri and a tuna roll, house made gyoza, rainbow/ dragon rolls, and a large hot sake. We enjoyed the homemade tofu, gyoza, and mackerel- they were tasty, flavorful and comforting. The nigiri was decent, but some fish didn't taste as fresh and were a bit tough. The rolls were ok, but small. I appreciated the real crab in the rolls but found a few hard crab shell pieces I had to spit out.  Prices are steeper and for 3 ppl, our bill was about $120 and we weren't that full. Good thing we had planned to get dessert afterwards. Glad to have tried it, nonetheless."

        "Jennifer C.": "Nestled next to kitchen story, Eiji is a cute little Japanese restaurant with delicious homemade food. Seating caps out at 5 people. The staff speak Japanese to each other - a very authentic restaurant with sushi, fish, among other entrees. My go-tos are the seaweed salad, homemade ankake tofu, chirashi bowl, and strawberry mochi for dessert with hot tea. Both tofu and mochi are only available for dining in. I don't usually like red bean, but the light smear of it does really blend well for the strawberry mochi. Chirashi bowl is generous in fish and the sushi rice is delectably done. There's never been a wait in the times I've gone, but it's gotten pretty full with only a handful of tables. Reliably delicious and quick to serve entrees, I always stop by here on my way to u:dessert for bingsu after!"

        "Stefanie C.": "I love writing updated reviews for places I originally visited 7 years ago. That was the case for Eiji, which I've been to countless times starting in 2015. This is such a quaint and peaceful place that will satisfy any sushi craving. It's a small restaurant, so you have to get lucky sometimes with the wait. Once seats are filled up, waiting can be anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Regardless, totally worthwhile. The first time I came here, my friend ordered the Chef's Choice Deluxe Sushi Platter ($26.25) which has 11 pieces of nigiri and 1 roll. We also got the Chef's Choice Regular Sashimi ($14.25) which has 9 pieces of sashimi. This was a good amount of food for two people, and our waitress actually encouraged us to order more since the kitchen was closing. I love that they have these Chef's Choice options to save me from actually making a decision when I just really want good sushi!  This is probably some of the freshest sushi and sashimi I have ever tasted. Coming here, I would prefer eating nigiri and sashimi instead of ordering a fancier roll. Keep things simple, you know? We also had delicious hot tea and an ice cold Asahi to complement our meal. These days I just get the chirashi bowl. Overall one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. Wonderful, authentic experience. Thank you Eiji!"

Food: 8/10 The food was absolutely amazing! I'd definitely recommend their specials and checking out the small plates. My personal favorites were the monk fish liver and you absolutely must order the mochi strawberry! It was so perfectly tart, yet sweet and had me hooked. The fish was also super fresh and delicious. Price & Portion: 6/10 The prices are pretty standard for sushi. I think we ended up paying around $50 per person (and this is including dessert). We definitely left feeling full! Service: 7/10 The service was great here! There was a bit of a wait when we went, but we just walked around the neighborhood a bit. Ambience: 8/10 The restaurant is super small and intimate feeling. It's the perfect place for a casual date or catching up with friends."

I love the food that I got today but I didn't try a lot of things. - Warm homemade tofu with the starchy sauce, a tiny bit of ginger, julienne chopped shishi and scallion. Perfect for a chilly day in SF - Hotate nigiri: fresh & good - Unagi roll with avocado and cucumber. It's so simple but very good. The avocado was creamy while cucumber was crunchy & fresh. Dessert: - homemade strawberry mochi. One order per person. I couldn't convince them to give me 2 T_T it's so goood. Not too sweet, which can be quite common with Japanese mochi. It's like the one I ate in The Big Island, Hawaii.  I will definitely come back. "

I can't believe this is my visit visit to TLC cuz it was awesome! There a little something for everyone, meat, veggie and they will even accommodate this vegan The salsa bar is great and the food is as fresh and delish and the wait was short. We came close to closing and we ate nearly alone . Only wish the flour shell was corn instead or even just a flat corn tostada round. Few weeks later, I stopped again for a to go order with my crew on way to ice skating and picked up burritos and a quesadilla . I felt like they were enjoyed by all and the proportions were comparable if not larger, while my ride or die Papalote kids said they were good but wanted papalote next time.

It was really disappointing because I wanted a baby burrito with soyrizo added and it was just mush at room temp. There should be a balance of ingredients and textures in a burrito. I asked for cabbage. They gave me about a tablespoon. Also the size was about the same as a full size though less full.  I just Know if I can figure out what exactly to order (and how), I will be able to come up with something that I like from there.

        "Brett G.": "Fast casual Mexican spot serving up tacos and more. Overall, the food is slightly overpriced even compared to other spots on Polk Street and a notch down in flavor even though it is serviceable. This is based on 3 visits over the past year or so. When it comes to taco spots, I usually compare based on the Al Pastor, which can be difficult to pull off as it can be both too sweet or not flavored enough but it's hard to stand out at either extreme. Unfortunately, the5 tacos were quite underwhelming. The meat was not very flavorful. It was relatively lean, which is fine. However, they also place a ton of cheese on the bottom of the tacos. The cheese is not flavorful either and the amount of cheese and grease coming off it overwhelms what flavor there is for the meat. Tortillas were decent but nothing special. On the plus side, you do get a lot of meat per taco. The biggest detractors though were the rice and beans. The beans were mediocre, not particularly flavorful, but the rice was flavorless and lifeless. For the price (about $16.50 for 2 tacos + rice + beans), there are many better meals in the area. Normally I'd drop this to 2 stars but I'm open to other options being decent."

This review is valid for fresh food - I'm not a fan of takeout, a lot of the flavor is somehow compromised in takeouts from this place. Food: - My special favorite is the soyrizo - embracing a vegan option as a Mexican food joint already makes TLC rare, and then spicing up the soyrizo beautifully just makes TLC the unbeatable Mexican food choice for me. Unique selling points: - they have delicious vegan options - they use organic ingredients - have a wonderful salsa bar Another great thing about TLC is that it is situated next to an amazing shaved ice cream place called Powder!

Food:  Overall - absolutely fantastic. Everything was in fact super RICH and filling (but not greasy or fatty which is impressive) i felt sooooo full afterwards (though not bloated haha).  Porcini doughnuts [5/5]: sooooo yummy. Reminds me of brazilian cheesy bread but better. Nice umami flavor, warm, crispy, and chewy. The cheese was just the right consistency and this dish was heaven. Highly recommend and I think is superior to just getting simple bread and butter as a starter.  Aged beef dumplings [3.5/5]: they were yummy but i think because of how amazing everything else on the menu is - they kind of fell flat and got overshadowed. Fatty, juicy, great taste and quality but wasn't wow'd.  Beef tartare [5/5]: probably one of the BEST beef tartares i've had - super creamy, melts in your mouth. The pickled cauliflowers added a nice tang that helped cut through the richness of the beef and the aioli (looked and tasted like aioli). The chips were a bit on the greasy side but still super crunchy and crispy.  Dungeness Crab [5/5]: super lucky because the server told us today was the last day it was going to be on the menu (crab season coming to a close) - absolutely loved the freshness of this dish and compared to everything else, was super light. Liked the tangy bitterness of the pomme and the presentation was also pretty neat.  Bucatini [4/5]: it was good, honestly the bone marrow didn't elevate the pasta. It just seemed like a separate side. The pasta itself tasted like an elevated bolognese, texture was great and super chewy. Wouldn't have been disappointed if we skipped this however.  Tonnarelli [5/5]: super creamy, heavy pasta. Loved it but damn - can only eat a couple bites of this. The uni is creamed into the sauce, so there isn't actually chunks of it (which i was slightly disappointed with) but you can 100% taste the uni in the sauce.  Ribeye [4/5]: its steak. It's cooked well. Sala verde was good - a little heavy on the dill but still yummy. The dungeness crab latkes however def stole the show here - would 100% just order those separately as a side.  Grapefruit/peach (i forget what it was) milk ice [5/5: super light dessert - definitely needed that after a rich, flavorful, heavy dinner lol."

The tasting menu was about $125 pp and they offered to upgrade the steak dish to a ribeye for $10 more pp. The ribeye steak was only $60, we all got a small piece as \"part\" of the tasting. Tasting menu basically included about 3/4th of the menu for the night. The food itself was delicious but I have difficulty justifying the amount we all paid. Total bill before tax/tip/alcohol was $675. If we would have literally gotten every single item on the menu and multiple appetizers and done a family style meal it wouldn't have been over $400.  I would come back and order their regular menu items. Tasting menu was a huge rip off in my opinion. Service and drinks were good."

        "Sneha P.": "Rich table was absolutely fabulous! Everything from the service to the food was stellar. My partner and I had a great experience and wiped pur plates clean! We ate every single morsel of our food and drank every drop of our cocktails. We started with the chili crunch dumplings. They were delicious! They make their chili crunch in house and sell it for $8. For our mains we shared the tonnerelli sea urchin cacio e pepe and the grilled black cod. They were both SO yummy! Our favorite was the pasta thoiugh. Our cocktails were also tasty! I don't think it was one of my too favorite cocktails. But the food was the main event and will make me come back. It is hard to get a reservation but it was well worth the wait."

        "Austin W.": "I was lucky enough to snag a reservation to Rich Table this past Saturday for a party of two on the outdoor patio after a last minute cancellation. I was a bit apprehensive at first about the seating situation because another Yelper had pointed out how cold sitting outdoors was and how inadequate the blankets and heat lamps were, but I found this to be not the case at all: my wife and I were comfortable the entire meal sitting outdoors; no issue with the cold at all. We were lucky enough to have gotten Dana as the host for our table. She was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu, took her time to elaborate on any questions we had, and above all, extremely friendly. We were initially thinking about doing a-la-carte for the evening, but after Dana described that my wife and I would be receiving different dishes for each course if we both got the tasting menu and could try out everything between the two of us, we immediately said yes. I love that Rich Table does this! We started our meal with cocktails and they were both very well balanced. Neither were alcohol forward at all, and were as described in terms of flavors. We ended up getting two cocktails each because we couldn't decide on just one. \"In High Du Monde\" and \"Nutty Confessor\" were my personal favorites. Since many reviews go into the dishes course by course, I'll spare the details here and just go over the highlights. My favorite dishes of the night were the porcini doughnuts with umami powder and raclette, the uni cacio e pepe, and crispy sunchoke risotto. Everything was perfectly seasoned and not once did I ever wish something was more salted. Course timing was perfect as well. I never felt like I was rushed between courses. Portion sizing was just right as well. I felt satisfied after our meal and not overly stuffed, and definitely not hungry. Rich Table is one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I would 100% recommend stopping by for a date night or special occasion if you're able to snag a reservation."

Our server Marcia was wonderful and provided great recommendations and wine pairings. Can't wait to return"

        "Bhavika T.": "Rich Table is by far one of my top 3 restaurants in SF. We love this place. We don't go often enough as reservations are hard to find.  Food- the sea urchin Cacio de Pepe is by far by favorite dish. The beef dumplings and porcini doughnuts are usually on our repeat list too. What I love about this place is their menu is seasonal with some favorites permanently on the list.  Ambience- cozy, tasteful and welcoming. I love that they have nice heated outdoor parklets too. The ambience is upbeat and trendy. Typical of Hayes valley vibe.  Service- the service is impeccable. The host, the servers are all amazing. We once bought their chili crunch and forgot to pick it up after dinner. They kept calling us so we wouldn't drive too far away.  Overall, we love this place and we hope we can return back every quarter."

        "Molly T.": "I'm wary of overhyped places, but I don't live in SF so I wasn't aware of the buzz surrounding Rich Table prior to my most recent trip here. As expected, the name is a double entendre: Rich is both the name of the chef and an apt descriptor of the food you'll eat here. Rich Table prides itself on serving local, seasonal ingredients, with a menu that features some year-round staples as well as many rotating dishes. As it turns out, the hype is warranted -- at least in my book. Our entire experience here, from the drinks to the food to the service, was exceptional.  We came here at 8:15 on a Tuesday night. I was lucky enough to be on my phone when a notify popped up from Resy, and I grabbed it quickly. I can understand why it's so hard to get a table here, because the space itself is fairly small and intimate. Before I get into the offerings, I need to give a huge shoutout to our server. She is quite possibly the best server I've ever experienced, and that's really saying something because I've met hundreds, maybe thousands. She knew where every last ingredients of every last dish was sourced from, she helped us plan out our meal such that we could sample a good chunk of the menu without getting overly full, and she was as personable as they come. It really does make the experience feel more memorable and personal when the service is great, and I know it's oftentimes a thankless job, so I want to give credit where it's due. Drink-wise, we sampled some cocktails as well as some wine. I started with the Shiso Popular (japanese gin, shiso, lemon), which was dangerously delicious. Shiso in cocktails is one of my very favorite things. Next, I tried the Persimmon Negroni (gin, campari, persimmon cordial, sherry, orange bitters), which was very good but I could've done with a little less ice in the glass -- a large ice block works but a packed glass of small ice cubes waters the drink down too quickly. I also tried the Riesling Kabinett Feinherb, which is one of the best Rieslings I've ever had.  Food-wise, as the party next to us assured us, it is seemingly impossible to go wrong here. There were no wrong notes the whole evening and we were quite full (but happily so) by the end. We got a nice variety of veggies and proteins, cold and warm preparations, small and large plates. I'd say we did darn good. Eats, below: Sardine Chips with Horseradish Creme Frache: A+ I can see why this is one of the dishes with staying power, whatever the season. Not only is there novelty, but these are also just so yummy. The saltiness of the chips pair perfectly with the spicy, earthiness of the creme fresh. You order these by the chip, so it would be silly not to try at least one. Market Vegetable Crudit w/ Charred Allium Yogurt: A We wanted some extra veggies because our order was lacking in them, and this was a great dish to add. The veggies were fresh and colorful and the dip was unique and delicious. Who says ordering crudite is boring?  Dungeness Crab, Red Curry, Pink Pomello, Spaghetti Squash, Smoked Trout Crumble: A+ Served in a crab shell, this dish was as delicious as it was aesthetically pleasing. Super creative, very flavorful and unlike anything I'd ever had before.  Abalone w/ Collard: A One of the smaller bites, this dish was fresh, creative and beautifully presented. Collards mimicked seaweed while the fish was served in a smooth, iridescent shell.  Tonnarelli, Sea Urchin, Cacio E Pepe, Idiazbal: A One of the signature dishes here, and for good reason. I have a gluten sensitivity and they were able to make this gluten free, which was much appreciated. The sea urchin flavored the sauce to make it extra rich and decadent -- this is the kind of plate you'll want to lick clean.  21 Day Dry Aged Ribeye, Larb, Green Curry, Cucumber, Herbs: A+ According to our server, we were lucky that this rib eye was available, as it doesn't always make it onto the menu due to availability. Though I'm not a big steak lover, I can still appreciate a perfectly executed steak. And because I'm a veggie lover, I also appreciated the cucumber and herbs served atop the steak, which complemented the richness of the steak beautifully."

We were fortunate to have the semi private area in the back for a larger party.  The restaurant is quaint charming and cozy. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. We opted for ordering different items to share started with a few slices of their Douglas Fir Levain bread. It was the most amazing fresh bread, a must try, but remember they charge $4/slice!! Gulp! We started with dried porcini donuts, another must try, fluffy and flavorful, the sardine chips were amazing, and was a great start for our dinner. We tried the TAMAKI GOLD RISOTTO, and \"CHAOSHAN POISON\" VONGOLE, MANILA CLAMS. Followed by the black cod and 21 DAY DRY AGED RIBEYE. Everyone really enjoyed the pasta dishes, they were prepared a La Dante and perfectly seasoned. The cod was absolutely my favorite. The ribeye was tender and moist. Perfect selection os a sample menu created by our party. We ended the dinner with sorbet and a chocolate pomegranate cake.  The dinner was about $100/pp which included 4 cocktails as well as a few bottles of sparkling water. A memorable evening in a warm atmosphere with great culinary experience."

Generally just felt like a comfortable place to sit down, eat, and talk.  All the staff that I interacted with were incredibly friendly and gave some great recommendations. Since I'm allergic to peanuts and nuts, I always ask servers if there's anything I should worry about or that I should avoid.

I thought this place was pretty good! went here during restaurant week 2023 (which I should've ordered but oh whale) and got the winter pie and the spritz. both were really good!!! spritz feels extremely normal and i guess its italian so can't go wrong here some friends I went got that and the arancini which looked really good. plates and decor have really good vibes, extremely cute, good date night spot. definitely recommend grabbing a reservation online if you want to come during a \"popular\" dinner hour only location issue is that its out in the richmond district which is hard to get to if you're not close."

        "Amanda C.": "This Italian spot is right around the corner from me and it has such a cute vibe, it has Bay Area themed wallpaper with faces like Mac Dre and elE-40 on it! But anyway, let's get to the important stuff! There's and outdoor patio if you have pets, but we sat inside because it was so cold. We got: - OG baby lettuce salad: the dressing had a creamy texture to it which I liked because it coated the lettuce. - clam pie pizza: this was my favorite thing by far, I loved the garlicky clam flavor, and liked that it also had an herby cheese flavor to compliment it! Also I'm a fan of thin crust pizza cause it doesn't make me feel so heavy afterward and that way I can eat more! - chitara alla cacio e pepe: this was really cheesy, and don't come for me but it's a little too cheesy for me compared to most cacio e Pepe's I've had. It was a little overwhelming and I didn't taste the pepper as much! Overall it's a nice restaurant to eat at and it's right in the heart of mid-Richmond district. Pro tip: use the chili oil on the table for EVERYTHING to add an extra kick!"

        "Henry L.": "We were very lucky this week and were allowed to be seated despite being a walk-in. So first tip, definitely make a reservation, because this place is extremely popular. You can also enjoy the cool wallpaper with some familiar faces such as E-40, Mac Dre, 2 $hort, Joe Montana, and others. They also show some iconic areas of SF such as Alcatraz, Golden Gate Bridge, etc. Regarding the food: 1) Nonna's Meatballs. Excellent appetizer that is savory, fragrant, with a nice touch of cilantro and cheese. The sauce is excellent (you may want to save some for the wings or pizza) 2) Herbed Chicken. You get drumsticks and wings. Although I am a drum-man, the wings impressed me! So tender with lots of flavor. They definitely put their heart into make these as delicious as possible 3) Sweet Corn Pie. It sounds weird, but the corn, red onion, and cheese are such an excellent, subtly done combination. 4) NYC Style Pie. This is a nice upgrade for the pep fans out there. Lots of small, tasty pepperoni over a strong layer of cheese. Well-done classic pep pie! Takeaways. It wont hurt your wallet, and the food is delicious. Kids get an awesome picture with some local neighborhood buildings, and can color them with crayons. Pizza comes out of an old-school brick oven that seems to be well-maintained, hot-hot-hot. The older Italian gentleman is super cool (I think he is the owner) and takes the spirit of service into his own hands. He made our whole party feel taken care of at all times, despite being busy managing the logistics of to-go orders and bussing around trying to get everyone's dishes on the table piping hot. You have to admire his meticulousness (even the way one stacks to-go orders has to be in line with his principled spirit of service and organization). Also, there seems to be some seating in the back that is half indoors half outdoors. Try to get back there for some good vibes."

        "Yaxun J.": "This pizza place is now one of my favorites to go to. I got the burrata pie and the salsiccia pie which were both fantastic. The flavors of the tomatoes on the burrata pie were so good in that the tomatoes had a nice sweetness to them while being slightly sour and not overwhelmingly so. Then the creaminess of the burrata pairs super well with it. As for the salsiccia pie, I really loved the calabrian chili salsa verde which was perfect with it. Moreover, the extra parmesan cheese they provide for all pies is fresh and super flavorful unlike the usual that's provided in other places. They also have a nice hot chili oil that really adds to the flavor profile. Besides this the rigatoni al bolognese classico was also pretty solid, but I'd say my attention was more drawn to the pizzas."

        "Jacky C.": "We went here with a group of friends. Where we all shared the food family style. We all ordered a lot of food. All the pastas x2. A good amount of the pizzas and two bottles of sparkling wine.  I'm going to start off with the service. The service was a little slow at the start took us 10-15 minutes to finally get to order after trying to actively get the attention of a waiter. But overall the people were nice after that wait.  The food overall was alright, but for the price it was a little disappointing in a way. A lot of the pasta was extremely al dente even for someone like me who likes their pasta al dente. I feel like a good amount of the food missed the mark on flavor as well. The mushroom risotto had more flavor than the fungi pizza. The pizza with the burata pie was pretty gloppy. Not to mention there wasn't any complementary bread for an Italian place that's a little disappointing. The wine was good though.  If I would recommend a dish it would be the mushroom risotto and the top shelf pizza. Overall this place was alright, but definitely not a place I would go to again."

Reading their business bio, they mention no frills, and that's exactly what I look for in a burger.  Since it was my first time, I asked what they best thing on the menu. The answer I got was 'everything' which is my pet peeve of answers because let's be real, not everything on the menu can be A+. After a friendly back n forth, they recommended the 'El Jefe' because they liked spicy, which is exactly what I love as well.  They use angus meat and the patties are pretty darn tasty. The bun could've used a little bit more toast, but the ingredients, sauces and overall flavor of the burger was pretty good. The size of the burger was good for a regular appetite, but for a big eater like me, I think I could go double patty if that's the option.  Their fries I enjoyed as well. They were crispy and loaded with salt and pepper. I can see the amount of S&P being too much for some, but it was perfect for me. Better to have some seasoning than nothing at all. I asked for a side of ranch which comes in packet. I should've asked for the chipotle sauce because that's homemade and I kept hearing other ppl ask for it. Next time for sure.  While I don't live in the neighborhood, this is one of those spots that if I did, I'd probably eat here once a week. No frills, good flavor, and good pricing. A big burger and fries was $14, which for San Francisco, I've paid a lot more and got a lot less.  If you find yourself in the neighborhood, looking for a quick bite or needing to satisfy that burger craving, Uncle Boy's might be the best option for you."

Outside has beautiful views but it was pretty cold so we dined inside. There's a bar area, tables, and multiple 2-person (bar?) table in the middle area. We ordered the clam chowder, 6 pcs of fresh oyster (mixed), bread&butter, and shrimp sandwich that came with bay fries. The bay fries was seasoned and it was crispy and delicious! I'm not sure what kind of seasoning (looked slightly red and reminded me of Cajun). The fresh oysters are a definite must but if I come visit again, I'll probably not get the clam chowder.  I think everything is reasonably priced but they do have a 6% surcharge. Very big list of wines, some beers, and mixed drinks.  Parking can definitely be a little difficult!

Clam Chowder 8/10 I love the fact that they are fresh clams simmered in heavy cream and little potatoes. They were lacking a bit of flavor. Salt, pepper and thyme would have done the trick.  Pomelo Salad 9/10 Wow! The grapefruit, blood oranges, cheese, hazelnuts and vinaigrette were amazing! I loved it! A tiny bit of salt would have gone a long way.

What we ordered;  -Rustic Seafood Stew: It's SF, so ofc the seafood's gonna be fresh no matter what. But, the flavors of the stew itself was yummy! The tomato base wasn't too tart/sour & the ACME levain toast paired well. - Clam Chowder: The star of the show! This is the first chowder I've had where they served it with whole clams. We had asked for our order to be split into two bowls & each bowl still came out fairly loaded. Super creamy, super delicious! Totally coming back again for this!  Grilled Cheese Sandwich: Cheesy, crispy, & delicious! Our server was so nice & also subbed the side of pickles with fries for us.

We got the grilled oysters with chili and it was so so so yummy (kind of tasted of middle eastern flavors :D ). Super creamy and fatty as well.  Grilled cheese [4/5]: was a pretty good grilled cheese. Nothing more haha Shrimp po boy [4/5]: fantastic sauce, fresh shrimp - overall good. Thought the fries were kind of salty.

        "Leslie B.": "I wanted to try the best Clam Chowder in SF and after some research on Reddit, locals pointed me to Hog Island Oyster. It is inside the Ferry Building, but you have to enter the restaurant from the outside entry.  The oysters are highly recommended here and I tried the 1/2 dozen. They serve them alongside some lemon and a vinegar mixture with green onions. They were absolutely phenomenal! The clam chowder is also 10/10. They serve it with whole clams in the shell, large potatoes, and bacon. It is not very thick but a more liquid soup! My husband got fish and chips with old bay fries and they were so crispy and delicious!"

        "Andy P.": "Wow.. this was a nice surprise. Wife and I decided to go for a stroll and walked by this place along the Ferry Building. If we can grant 4.5 stars, this place is a solid. While I questioned their clam chowder being more liquid than what I was use to, it was pretty darn good! You'll come across this dilemma but you know what, try it. I could see how some would prefer the thicker version and not like the texture. But if you give thought to the flavor and it's different take, you'll be surprise that this can be part of your expectations around clam chowder. We both loved it. Oysters were delicious and fresh. Geoduck ceviche was also a surprise dish. Our light meal was quite the talk after we left the establishment.  If you are in the area and looking for a place to grab a light snack with a drink or a full meal, this place is a solid choice. Hope you enjoy and have a pleasant experience as we did."
